                "body": "<p>Ok, I’ll get the ball rolling with some thoughts..</p> <p>I am Jewish, born in the uk 1960, and have always had an emotional response to the Germans and their conduct in the second world war. </p> <p>Whilst I believe that there were a lot of evil people in Germany during the war, such that there was a kind of “collective guilt”, I have also believed that you can not blame an entire nation, nor their children.</p> <p>With that in mind I watched this with great interest I watched and was actually captivated by it. I think I even enjoyed it!</p> <p>Germany was portrayed as a horrible place to live, especially for the “ordinary “people who must have been conflicted. Each brother seemed to know he’d lost his soul and his humanity and I guess it must have been difficult to resist the pressure to fit in. Humans readily accept the norm as being ok.<br />And yet, most Germans did go along with things and you do wonder how much they succumbed to this –eg the family that took the flat of the Jewish family that was featured, readily took on the anti –Semitic stance of the regime with apparent ease. Perhaps there was a “German mentality” which is a phrase that I have heard used many times.</p> <p>So my conclusion is that this was a programme worth watching addressing difficult issues, that did not deny what a terrible place Germany must have been and that there was a cost to the country and its people. As a drama it felt well put together too. What it possibly could have addressed was the role that the German opposition took throughout Nazi rule took and if it had support, however passive, amongst the people.</p>",

So many times we have seen this all over the world - surely I don't need to start listing examples.</p> <p>In fact, I think it's dangerous to start throwing around the idea that these things occur because of a preponderance of inherently evil people, as if the people there at the time were qualitatively different to ourselves, because it lulls us into a false sense of security that it couldn't happen here, All you need, for example, is economic hardship, a relatively defenceless minority and cynical racist politicians with no qualms about exploiting the situation to gain power and inflict suffering on &quot;the other&quot;. Suddenly the scenario doesn't seem so alien, does it........</p>",

Clearly, there was nothing unique about the Germans, just that historical circumstances were such that this awful barbarity took hold in an advanced and cultured nation. The rise of the Nazis should indeed be seen as a warning from history. My objection to Generation War is that it paints a false picture of innocence among a group of young Germans, who on the one hand are portrayed as fully supporting Hitler and the war (at the start at least) and on the other as being innocent of the true nature of Hitler's regime. Totally unbelievable!</p>",

The day after they were &quot;fascist thugs&quot;.</p> <p>In &quot;When a Crocodile Eats the Sun&quot;, Peter Godwin writes movingly of the political betrayal suffered by his father and mine:</p> <p>&quot;In the summer of 1946, the huge victory parade takes place down the Mall in London. Two million onlookers cheer wildly as King George V1 takes the salute from Allied soldiers of dozens of nations. In the skies overhead there is a massive fly-past. but though they are the fourth biggest Allied army, no Polish forces march that day. The new Warsaw regime, at Stalin's insistence, ignores its British invitation and stays away. And the Free Poles have not been invited. Anyway, they have nothing to celebrate. While everyone else is jubilant, many of them watch the victory parade in tears.<br />&quot;The new Polish government said we were traitors, just a bunch of fascist thugs, and I realized I would never be able to go home to Poland&quot;. says my father. &quot;And Cania, who had stayed behind with our unit in Germany, after I'd been sent back for officer training, realized the same thing. He couldn't bear it. He walked out of his tent one evening and shot himself&quot;.</p> <p>In the wake of the war, Poland was betrayed and handed over to Stalin, and it seems we have been vilified ever since. Apparently we feature as &quot;baddies&quot; in this TV programme (which I haven't seen).</p> <p>We have had a good lesson in the wisdom of staying neutral, I will say that. The countries that managed to do so did not suffer as Poland did, nor do they come in for this constant vilification.</p>",

Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union would have attacked it no matter if it is a neutral country or not.</p> <p>I can understand why many Polish people after all the country went though in the last century feel a deep mistrust towards foreign powers, Russia and Germany of course, but also Western powers who didn't really helped them. But still: Sometimes I have the impression that many Polish people are way too much invested in their country#s role as the eternal victim. Yes, Poland suffered terribly, but the way you commemorate it turns everything into an idealised and glorified myth of tragic heroism.</p>",

But I think the lesson to be learnt is to do all we can to stay out of these wars.</p> <p>I don't think that Poland's history, while sad, is a history of tragic heroism. Does anyone think that? The 20th Century was tragic for Poland, but so it was for many peoples. And the horrors go on worldwide to this day.</p> <p>And actually all history is sad if you come to think of it. Like most peoples lives seems sad, seen in retrospect. At the moment &quot;all creation is groaning together and being in pain together&quot;. </p> <p>Being vilified... well, judging from the review above we appear as villains, not as heroic freedom fighters. Its very different from the way that, for example, the French resistance is usually portrayed. Why?</p> <p>And the re-defining of Nazi concentration camps as &quot;Polish&quot; has become so widespread that three British MPs actually issued a press release protesting it.</p> <p>It said, in part: “The location of most of these camps by Nazi Germany in what was then<br />occupied Poland does not justify the description &quot;Polish&quot;. We do not<br />refer to ancient amphitheatres in France as &quot;French&quot; but as &quot;Roman&quot;;<br />we do not refer to the Krak des Chevaliers castle in Syria as a<br />&quot;Syrian&quot; but as a &quot;Crusader&quot; fortress; we do not refer to the former<br />colonial slave forts in Ghana as &quot;Ghanaian&quot; but as &quot;British&quot;; we do<br />not refer to Guantanamo Bay camp in Cuba as &quot;Cuban&quot; but as &quot;U.S.&quot;. In<br />each case the symbol of oppression is associated by its description<br />with the perpetrator and not the territory in which it is currently<br />sited.”</p> <p>And I have never seen the notorious Japanese POW camps described as other than &quot;Japanese&quot;, though they were sited in various different countries. I have to wonder why the rules change when it comes to Poland?</p> <p>I am not obsessive about it - just noting it.</p>",

After all, historical novels are both fiction and non-fiction in one, just as Generation War is, and it's not always easy to distinguish between the two. But as with good historical novels, good historical dramas involve a significant amount of research that goes into creating a story. Ok, so it's not going to be perfect and it's not going to be error free, but no retelling of anything is perfect. Let's not forget Stephen Ambrose's penchant for...embellishment. Does that diminish the impact of Band of Brothers? I know it doesn't for me, but really, where do we draw the line in how we retell history?</p>",

And in many ways that's the beauty of it. We think WWII and we think Hitler and Holocaust. But Generation War challenges us to look beyond that, to look at other aspects of the war. I don't think the writers of Generation War were looking for the perfect explanation, and they certainly weren't making apologies. They were bringing another aspect of the war to life, and yes, license was needed. But just because it's not centred on the Holocaust or Hitler doesn't make it disingenuous.</p> <p>And I really don't know if the majority of Germans agreed with the war as payback for WWI, but I would be surprised if that were accurate. Also, even if a majority thought it was good, it doesn't encompass all. And 51% in favour still means 49% are not.</p>",

In minutes the windows had been smashed and the doors forced. When we arrived, the swine were driving the wee mites out over the broken glass, bare-footed and wearing nothing but their nightshirts. The nurses, doctors, and attendants were being kicked and beaten by the mob leaders, most of whom were women.</p> </blockquote>  <p>or this from Daily Telegraph reporter Hugh Greene:</p>  <blockquote>  <p>Mob law ruled in Berlin throughout the afternoon and evening and hordes of hooligans indulged in an orgy of destruction. I have seen several anti-Jewish outbreaks in Germany during the last five years, but never anything as nauseating as this. Racial hatred and hysteria seemed to have taken complete hold of otherwise decent people. I saw fashionably dressed women clapping their hands and screaming with glee, while respectable middle-class mothers held up their babies to see the &quot;fun&quot;.</p> </blockquote>",

The few who hadn't immigrated or yet been deported would have had a miserable experience left behind of being permanently abused and spat at and it's simply not plausible that they could have partaken of a scene of carefree fun at the opening of the film. Besides that I believe it was a serious offence for Jews to go anywhere without wearing a yellow star.</p> <p>The makers simply went too far to make the characters likeable to a modern young audience and to suggest that the corruption began with the war and not before is also taking the license to dangerous excess. Most Germans were already heavily indoctrinated and identified fervently with the Nazi system, its goals and its virulent hatred and persecution of the Jews.</p> <p>I was outraged by the writer who said they have 'no responsiblity' to portray history accurately. Writers should be given the right to take liberties with history for dramatic license, but when you're dealing with a topic like the Nazis and the Holocaust you have to tread carefully or you risk stepping over into revisionism, intentional or not, and I think this went close.</p> <p>In the film <i>Starship Troopers</i> we're given a fascinating albeit tongue-in-cheek portrayal of a Nazi-like society where everyone - even the audience - is invited to identify with a fascist system and the characters, who just accept their behaviour and the way society is ordered as normal. That portrayal of a fascist psychology was in many ways a more accurate, seductive and subversive depcition of life in a Nazi society was like than the admittedly enjoyable but unreal fantasy of <i>Generation War</i>. Despite its powerful dramatic impact I don't think history will be kind to this series.</p>",

As for the friendship between them, the point of drama is to show what could happen, not what did happen. As Pirandello once remarked, reality will always beat the most fervent imagination. I think by criticising the friendship between the five young people, including one Jew, people are not criticising its improbability, but its function in humanising them. To an extent, this is a device, to make their eventual downfall and loss of innocence even more dramatic. And I think this is the point: people do not want to accept that these young Germans were innocent to start with, or in any way victims of the regime. But to an extent they were; they had grown up within Nazism and had known nothing else. The fact that they had preserved a certain amount of humanity and idealism, seems too much for most viewers who either want to cling on to the fiction that all Germans were guilty monsters, or want to stress their inhumanity to better distance themselves from them.</p>",

The sense of British superiority has obviously waned of late but let's not kid ourselves that the Nazis were unique. Think US policy in Vietnam, Soviet treatment of the Kulaks, Turkish oppression of Armenia, Serb atrocities in Srebrenica, the genocide in Rwanda.....all fostered by a sense of superiority.</p> <p>This series has humanised some of the thought processes behind Germany's descent into madness and it is to it's credit that it doesn't pull too many punches.</p> <p>Let's hope for our children and grandchildren we will never witness it's like again.</p>",

There's also the question of how representative would this group have been of young Germans, and by picking out what would have been a highly unusual and extraordinary group who had 'preserved their humanity' it is arugably distorting our perception of the reality of Germany by that time. As I've noted below the mass of evidence suggests the vast of majority of Germans, and in particular the young, were enthusiastic supporters of the regime and its goals and participated willingly even revelling in atrocities, and were not under duress to do so as the film suggests.</p>",

You and the poster before demonstrate this dangerous tendency to relativse these crimes and lump them with others as much of a muchness that ends up apportioning blame for such crimes equally as this series has attempted to do.</p> <p>In particular your attempt to equate Nazi genocide and its war of annihilation in Russia with ‘US policy in Vietnam’ is quite simply offensive and a good example of the glib and facetious historical parallels that warped interpretations of history like this provoke. </p> <p>Apart from the fact that the Vietnam War mobilized enormous opposition across US society from its outset, not least among the youth and the media, and which was one of the main reasons for the US decision to ultimately deescalate and withdraw. That was something totally inconceivable in Nazi Germany, where ordinary Germans fought to the bitter end for Hitler’s criminally insane regime, sending children to die in suicide attacks, a perverse paradox this series unfortunately doesn’t begin to explain.</p>",

There have been endless documentaries on hitler this and hitler that on German TV in the past. Maybe these should be shown on the BBC and we could discuss these in detail.</p> <p>No, I think the intention was to just show a present day German audience in a somewhat convoluted and sepia tinged way something of what &quot;our mothers and fathers&quot; did or didn't do. And to an extent it did just that. </p> <p>I watched this on German TV with my father who was 14 at the end of the war. He lived in a small rural town. He only spoke about his youth when asked but watching this series opened quite a flood of memories for him and I am grateful I was there to listen.</p> <p>He feels tremendous guilt and regret. <br />And no, he was not involved in the hitler youth, had to help on the farm. He has memories of various things, incl. people raiding the ware house of Jewish owned meat canning factory and seeing two men hanged. He was not involved in any of this and neither were his family but of course they did nothing to stop it. His only &quot;war action&quot; was being put into uniform with a gun in April 45 to defend the town - together with other school kids. When he was confronted by a member of the approaching US army and was able to tell them his name and age in his school English, they send him home.</p> <p>He said that this past will never leave us and he said that he has carried this shame with him all is life, this shame and this enormous feeling of guilt that he as a boy trusted and looked up to people - his teachers in school, his parents, his older brothers and cousins - who really must have known what was going on and who did nothing. He trusted them and accepted their judgement. He was healthy and young, he could read and ask. How could he have been so ignorant, so stupid and so inactive.</p> <p>There was little or no talk about the war during my childhood. I used to be outraged by this silence and used every opportunity to confront and to argue - still do. My father was not someone who would give out rules, but he was adamant about one thing, never join a crowd, stay away from the masses. Question authority, he always preached and we would yawn.</p> <p>I wonder how many other families in Germany had similar discussions after watching.</p>",

If that doesn't keep you satisfied then try the bibliography I imagine you'll find enough for a life time. </p> <p>And since you find it so easy to trash and rubbish the hard work of archivists and reputable historians I suggest you spend some time at the PRO and get an idea of how much hard work and expertise goes into that and maybe study some serious history while you're at it.</p>",

If you've read those books and claim they are of 'no use' then it appears you have a very high standard of schlarship which not even the best works seems to satisfy and which inidcates someone searching for an explanation that fits his own <i> a priori </i> assumptions on the subject and that itself shows a closed mind, something you accused me of! Also dismissing a major archival find as an unimportant or insiginificant without justification shows you have an agenda that no amount of evidence will change. If you're not yet a denier you sound very much lke an apologist and not far off denial.</p> <p>iii. I don't see what 'post conflict reconcliation' has to do with this? But if that's your bag then I recommend you read the book about lawyers in Germany I listed that shows the power and influence of former Nazi lawyers and judges in the German legal profession long after the war, and their lack of contrition or symapthy for the regime's victims who continued to suffer as well. This is well known and now acknowlegded in Germany: look in the post war government, civil and diplomatic service well into the 70s, the Nazi elite was as entrenched, unapologetic and privileged as they had been under Hitler - if not more so - and underlines once again how deep and committed was that generation to the regime and its ideology. No pressure, no threat of retaliation, no excuses that you and other posters existed to coerce them but that still didn't change their attitude, and informed study of Nazi society shows definitively German society stood solidly behind Hitler from beginning to end. Case closed! </p> <p>Only with the emergence of a newer, younger generation of activists in the late 60s did that shift and a real examination of that period and acknowledgment of the depth of complicity and commitment of their parent's generation to Hitler begin, which goes against the apologistic explanations you have offered and which the series seems keen to revive and the reason I beleive it will not stand the test of time or scholarship and why it's rightly been panned by real 'experts' which clearly you are not!</p>",

                        "body": "<p>I think that you make too many sweeping generalisations. The regime certainly wasn't supported by everyone and Hitler probably couldn't believe his luck when he came to power, when nearly all subsequent historical commentary suggest that his political influence was on the wane when he was invited to form a government. However, he ruthlessly removed all opposition (read communists and social democrats, as well as any others who could be classified as 'endangering national security') within a few months of taking power. Ideological opponents had already been identified and were incarcerated, surveilled or curtailed in their activities. Close to where I live (in Germany) there is a concentration camp (KZ) where 600 political prisoners where held from 1933-35, including Kurt Schumacher a prominent SPD (Social Democrat) post-war leader - he was later transferred to Dachau. These camps were 2 of hundreds that sprung up to control Germans within months of Hitler taking power. This policy coupled with special (kangaroo) courts (Sondergerichte) flamed fear, suspicions and effectively curtailed much anti-nazi activity. Over 3.5 million Germans spent time in KZs, over 70,000 were executed for one form of resistance or other.<br />There are often comments about how the German people went along with the nazis, but it is very difficult to resist when your life or your family's is threatened by your actions. Meanwhile for a sizeable number of the population, Hitler provided jobs and put bread on the table of the poorest families. It is difficult for us to know, with our relative affluence today, that not so long ago bread and a job were enough to secure someone's trust and support. Why would they question if most things (even the start of Hitler's war from 1939-40) appeared to support the Nazis' assertions of German supremacy -I don't recall uprisings or resistance by loyal Brits about the wrongs of colonialism while the going was good. As for the more intelligent, I suspect they knew to keep their heads down. Are the Iraqi people any less for not having resisted Saddam or Camodians Pol Pot? No. They too faced a situation where their resistance would only mean their death.</p> <p><i>Generation War</i> is a fiction and there are some inconsistencies, but as a representation of the descent of men to madness and murder it works. I fail to see how anyone is trying to get off the hook here. The scene of the SS officer shooting the jewish girl is damning of the type of appalling violence that Germans were involved in. Or the wider story of Viktor Goldstein (the Jewish friend) facing anti-semitism from others than Nazis is representative of some european attitudes then and sadly still know. Still stronger is the descent of Friedhelm from educated man of letters to compromised and slavish obedience -primarily as a way of surviving. The representation of Wilhelm as an army soldier rather than a nazi is also reasonable as the army saw itself as an honourable and disciplined unit at least to start with in the war. I fail to see what is wrong with describing any or all of these people as victims. We are all victims of our choices as well as the behaviour of others. All sullied by our experiences. In Germany, this series was important as it prompted grandchildren and children to ask their parents, what did you do in the war? Perhaps a last chance to question a generation again.</p> <p>It seems very easy for us to stand at a distance and make judgements, without much idea of what it was like. However, what is clear, not only from this three part series but from our knowledge of conflict, is that once people feel threatened or see their neighbours bombed or killed, the sense and urgency of survival kicks in. In this state, people unite and fight, not for any great reasons or support for an ideology, just to survive.<br />FYI, my family is English, Irish, Polish and Jewish. I don't hold much to such ethnic descriptions (put it this way, it doesn't define me). I only offer that information so that I'm not categorised as an apologist for German culpability, which I am most definitely not.</p>",

The question was the attitude of ordinary Germans in this case the oridinary soldiers and the evidence in contrast to the sanitised version presented here, is that most German soldiers took part in atrocities willingly, even enthusiastically it's documented in the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.de/Soldaten-Protokolle-K%C3%A4mpfen-T%C3%B6ten-Sterben/dp/3596188733/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1400230459&amp;sr=8-1-spell&amp;keywords=soldaten+nietzel\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Soldaten</i></a> I quoted earlier in thousands of hours of candid transcripts, which one of your co-apologists tried to dismiss in true revisionist style.</p> <p>But for me as I've already argued the most powerful argument for the guilt and complicity of most ordinary Germans in Nazi crimes was the entrenched and unapologetic attitudes and views of the post-war generation free of Hitler and any threat of retaliation from his security apparatus, expressed in many surveys, anecdotes and other evidence, who with a few reservations declared their continued support and approval for Hitler's regime and what he had attempted, the only regret being that he failed. This, a generation that shaped post war Germany and dominated its civil, diplomatic, legal and other professions which overflowed with former Nazis, a situation that only began to change in the '70s as their children began to push them out and demanded a reckoning with Germany's dark past.</p> <p>This film is not a whitewash but it swings back too far the other way, presenting a sanitised and unrealisic picture of the attitudes and behaviour of most ordinary Germans a form of mild, but still very questionable revisionism.</p>",

I'm sure your relatives will understand and appreciate you finding much to agree and common cause with those who turned a blind eye and privately approved of their destruction at the time. So congratulations on such sharing such illustrious company and confirming my earlier statement about those who fail to learn and undertstand the lessons of history. </p> <p>Can I suggest you change your name to Quisling or Lord HawHaw.</p>",

The most poetic and sensitive of the five was even ready to be mown down by Russian bullets, I suspect, not because he had become fully brain-washed, but because he realised what he had become.

This film attempts to portray Germans being placed in an impossible position and that they were in their own way 'victims', while the real nasties were anti-semitic Ukrainian collaborators, Polish partisans and the Red Army. A very dangerously seductive whitewashing that rides roughshod over thirty years of reseach into these matters.</p>",

It shows nice people, people with values and then how they are broken. It shows murderers and ignorants lashing out with illogic, fear and brutality and eventually getting precisely what they deserve. It shows the innocent (the old polish couple in their farm or the Jewish girl executed) being herded and terrorised with the cheapness of their lives. Friedhelm looks like a pretty willing executioner to me.</p>",

You couldn't possibly revere Hitler - be willing to die for the Fuhrer - on the one hand, whilst on the other hand thinking to yourself 'he's going a bit ape about the poor old Jews. They're surely not that bad'.</p> </blockquote>  <p>So incredibly simplistic I don't even know where to start.</p> <p>First of all, what do you even mean by &quot;being a Nazi&quot;?</p> <p>You have to distinguish between those who were genuine ideological Nazis (the party elite and the early adapters but yes, also many ordinary citizens), those who were &quot;opportunistic&quot; Nazis (it was a good career move) and those who were &quot;paper&quot; Nazis, who had little choice in the matter. </p> <p>Only the first group actually &quot;revered&quot; Hitler; the other couple included people with a very broad cross-section of opinions and, indeed, people with no opinion much whatsoever. (E.g., to cite one extreme, Oskar Schindler was a very successful &quot;opportunisic&quot; Nazi to the end!)</p> <p>Secondly, it's patently untrue that every (or even most soldiers) were &quot;willing to die for the Führer&quot;. Or even supported the goals of the Nazis. (You have to distinguish between the SS and the Wehrmacht.) Again, every man had his own story, but the truth on the ground was far more complicated than you describe. Many saw it as being willing to die for their country, as opposed to its regime, and many others simply saw it in terms of taking their oath of loyalty to their &quot;brother soldiers&quot; seriously.</p> <p>Indeed, the latter is the line taken by e.g. a number of active members of the White Rose resistance group, who <i>were</i> serving soldiers all the while they were also actively working to spark a popular revolt against Hitler! (I suggest you read or watch one of the numerous interviews with Fritz Hartnagel, the fiance of Sophie Scholl and later husband of one of her sisters, who survived Stalingrad, was judged a &quot;Mitläufer&quot;* by the de-nazification courts and who spent the rest of his life campaiging against war and fascism. He explained his thinking on this subject at the time very well - but I suspect the messy reality may exceed your black and white world view.) </p> <p>The other point you seem to entirely miss is that your average German soldier - in common with your average soldier at every time and place in history - was far more interested in <i>staying alive</i> than in <i>dying for anything</i>! Given that the draft was universal, being a conscientious objector was not an option and the penalty for desertion/refusing your call-up was death if you were caught, &quot;being willing to die&quot; was your only real option one way or the other! Doing it &quot;for Hitler&quot; gave you a better chance at survival than &quot;against Hitler&quot;.</p> <p>Frankly, I hope that had I been alive then, I would have had the courage of my convictions the way Sophie Scholl did of hers - but I'm honest enough to say, I'm not at all sure I would have. Would <i>you </i>have definitely refused military service/deserted and happily gone to the your execution instead? If you are willing to unequivocally say yes, then, with all due respect, I think you are lying, or you haven't actually thought about it deeply at all!</p> <p>*There is no real English equivalent to the German term <i>Mitläufer<br /> </i>, which I find a shame, as they exist at all times and in all places as well. Literally &quot;someone who goes along with something&quot;, referring to people take part in a movement, ideology and/or action in a minor role, and without genuinely believing in it - in contrast to genuine sympathisers or &quot;fellow travellers&quot;...</p> <p>A large number if not the majority <i>were</i> Mitläufer, as opposed to Hitler-worshippers, and I think you greatly underestimate the degree of &quot;indifference&quot; that was indeed present...</p>",

                        "body": "<p>I'm half Austrian. Perhaps, in your opinion, that makes me &quot;biased&quot;?</p> <p>My late Austrian grandma being an example. Born in 1912, into incredibly poor circumstances, she had no choice but to leave school to work in a shop at age 14. She was intelligent and intellectually curious, but her passions were art and music and literature, and till her dying day, two years ago, she remained a-political and completely disinterested in history and current affairs to a degree I (a political scientist &quot;by trade&quot; and self-described &quot;news whore&quot; and activist for as long as I can remember) found nearly impossible to even conceive! </p> <p>She was also ambitious, teaching herself stenography and to speak more nicely in her free time and working her way up to a secretarial job in the local government and a lower middle-class lifestyle. One she -painfully class-conscious and appearance-conscious to her dying day as well - already then worried was &quot;too good for&quot; her. And so, knowing nothing of politics and current events and caring even less, her middle-class, well-educated superiors and colleagues told her the Nazis were a &quot;good thing&quot; she assumed they, being so much more clever and worldly were probably right, without bothering to look into it much in detail. (Did she vote for the <i>Anschluss </i>? To be honest, I never - dared? - ask her; she probably either did or didn't vote at all, and if she did, it wasn't for ideological reasons, but because she <i>was</i> pretty much indifferent (she'd been born into a country which no longer existed, she'd already experienced three vastly different forms of government - the Austro-Hungarian empire, the first Austrian republic, and the short-lived home-grown fascist state - and the intervening chaos of the transitions, without being consciously <i>personally</i> affected by any of it) yet her &quot;betters&quot; (in her and society's opinion/in actual fact quite the opposite) told her to do so, and, in her words, &quot;they must be right&quot;.</p> <p>And then, because she worked for her local government, which overnight went from being &quot;Austrian&quot; to &quot;German&quot;, she <i>had to</i> join the Nazi party <i>on paper</i> to keep her job. At the beginning, she also saw the &quot;benefits&quot; of the Nazis - after all, they &quot;gave&quot; her her first paid vacation in over a decade and a half of full-time work -, and her naivite and genuine a-political <i>indifference</i> and the natural human tendency towards denial and repression kept her insulated from their full horror until it was too late. </p> <p>Was she &quot;anti-semitic&quot;? Certainly no more and indeed far less so than many other people of similar backgrounds in the U.K. and the U.S. at the time. Was she &quot;evil&quot;? Certainly not! Her &quot;crimes&quot; were of omission rather than commission.</p> <p>The man who later became my grandfather also worked for the local government, but in a far more senior function. He refused to join the Nazi Party, and was promptly fired Already too old to be drafted he was unemployed for the duration of the war. </p> <p>My grandmother's brother was a life-long Socialist. But he was equally poor and poorly-educated, and unlike her, was not ambitious. He was not &quot;leader&quot; material, he was no hero - which makes him no different from the vast majority of us. He remained a political activist, he continued to speak out openly against the Nazis as long as it was still &quot;safe enough&quot; to do so, and once it no longer was, he did so privately. And when he was drafted, he joined up and fought because - as &quot;wrong&quot; as you may find it - he <i>wanted to live</i>. As it happened, he didn't, dying a couple of weeks before the end of war; it took my grandmother/great-grandmother a few years to even find out that much and where. And it was only via Google and the paltry Red Cross documents they received that I could make an educated guess at the &quot;how&quot; a couple years ago - from injuries sustained by an America/British bombing raid, 3 days after the fact...</p> <p>So, was my grandmother &quot;a Nazi&quot;? Not according to the Americans who occupied her city - they didn't even judge her a candidate for minimal &quot;denazification&quot;, but seemlessly continued to employ her! </p> <p>Was her brother? Did he <i>deserve</i> to die? Are the children/grandchildren of those who killed him justified in gloating about it?</p> <p>Was my grandfather &quot;evil/cowardly&quot; for <i>merely</i> sacrificing his livelihood rather than his life?</p> <p>It's easy to self-righteously denounce all Germans as &quot;evil&quot; from your comfortable 2014 armchair. <i>Honestly</i> putting yourselves in their shoes isn't. </p> <p>And it hasn't escaped my notice that the very people who tend to bang on loudest about the Nazis are the very ones most eager to defend the flagrant disregard for the rule of law and the illegal wars our own current Western governments are engaged in!</p>",

But what was a bit rich was that, because of the way in which the programme was structured, they really seemed to be the most anti-Semitic of the lot (although we did have Ukrainians rounding up jews in an earlier episode). I think it got a bit stupid how anti jewish ideology was somehow seen as more important than the general fight against the Nazis. Basically they wanted Viktor to always be under threat so his scenes seemed to be a constant case of antisemitism one-upmanship.</p> <p>The programme did try to show how people can become indoctrinated by ideology particularly in the actions of the nurse Charly who was ready to report her assistant as Jewish with no thought for the consequences despite having a Jewish friend herself. It a horrendous and pathetic decision and somehow believable as people can be very inconsistent in their actions.</p>",

The notion that in 1941 the five central characters would not have realised Hitler's agenda in respect of the Jews, and other ethnic groups and minorities. Indeed, there is no open discussion of Hitler's &quot;final solution&quot; in any of the three episodes. What about the Hitler Youth? What about Goebbels' Jew-baiting propaganda? Kristallnacht? Mein Kampf?<br />3. The incredible notion that in 1941, Greta would have gone out openly in Berlin with her Jewish boyfriend, Victor (who made no attempt to hide his Jewishness).<br />4. The idea that Greta would be a supporter of Hitler in 1941, as she was clearly portrayed to be, despite having a Jewish boyfriend, and that she would then go to the opposite extreme and get a Gestapo lover. She clearly knew Victor was in danger, as she attempted to persuade the Gestapo guy to get Victor papers to enable him to escape to New York.<br />5. The demonisation of the Polish partisans as anti-semites prepared to kill Jews, in contrast with the sympathetic portrayal of the central characters, none of whom express anti-semitic sentiments.</p> <p>I understand that contemporary Germans might find it hard to accept that their own parents and grandparents committed mind-boggling war crimes, and would like a more sympathetic portrayal of innocent young people caught up in something they did not understand, and later could not get out of.

But yeah no Hitler Youth. But then again the BDM was present.</p>  <blockquote>  <p>What about Goebbels' Jew-baiting propaganda?</p> </blockquote>  <p>Because all Germans listened to it. Its basically present in the SS.</p>  <blockquote>  <p>Kristallnacht?</p> </blockquote>  <p>You can not really expect German writers to include it if they have never seen a Jew in their entire life.</p>  <blockquote>  <p>Mein Kampf?</p> </blockquote>  <p>The book that no one ever read.</p>  <blockquote>  <p>4. The idea that Greta would be a supporter of Hitler in 1941, as she was clearly portrayed to be, despite having a Jewish boyfriend, and that she would then go to the opposite extreme and get a Gestapo lover. She clearly knew Victor was in danger, as she attempted to persuade the Gestapo guy to get Victor papers to enable him to escape to New York.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I think that &quot;insert random politician here&quot; does some things right. But then again i think that some of the stuff he/she does and believes is wrong.<br />Yeah i know, amazing! Its almost as if you dont have to agree with everything a politician believes.</p>  <blockquote>  <p>5. The demonisation of the Polish partisans as anti-semites prepared to kill Jews, in contrast with the sympathetic portrayal of the central characters, none of whom express anti-semitic sentiments.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Yeah lets ignore the leader of the Polish fighters who wasnt anti-semitic and lets concentrate on those two who were.<br />Also lets forget the point-blank headshot of the Jewish girl by the SS officer or the train full of Jews bound for a camp. Or all the other &quot;fun stuff&quot; the Germans did. Like clearing the minefield. Thats what the good guys do.</p> <p>Its obvious that the Poles were the evil ones!</p>  <blockquote>  <p>I understand that contemporary Germans might find it hard to accept that their own parents and grandparents committed mind-boggling war crimes</p> </blockquote>  <p>&quot;All Germans back then committed war crimes and if you dont portray every single one of them doing those in the media its wrong!&quot;</p> <p>So which particular war crimes did my Grandfathers and their brothers commit exactly. Please provide a list of their war crimes with time, date and location. Thanks.</p>",

He is part of the Wehrmacht and the TV series shows quite clearly that war crimes were not restricted to the Nazi paramilitary forces attached to the army, the SS, and that Wehrmacht officers and soldiers were indeed complicit. This was not accepted for a long time in post-war Germany - at least till the 1970s.</p> <p>It may be a small point but the writer of this blog assumes that the surviving friends just happen to stumble upon each other in the bar at the end which would be a rather ridiculous co-incidence. Screen writers and dramatists do h use shorthand without 'filler scenes' so it seemed clear to me that the friends had already been able to connect after the war and had arranged to meet at the bar. We just weren't showed old-fashioned Hollywood style montages of the survivors writing to each other to set up the meeting. The producers assume the audience can fill in the gaps.</p>",

Watching it was rather like reading All Quiet on the Western Front for the first time - a story you know very well but from a different viewpoint.</p> <p>The final episode didn't quite match up to the first two, with coincidences that felt contrived for dramatic necessity and therefore a bit clunky (Lilja, Victor/Friedhelm's meeting, the final three meeting back in the bar where it all began), but it was absorbing and moving.</p> <p>I do agree with a lot of the criticisms - for example, barely anyone appeared to be an enthusiastic Nazi, except for the members of the Gestapo or SS. I thought it let ordinary Germans off too easily - but then again, it quickly moved the action away from Berlin to the Eastern Front and barely came back until the end. Even so, the fact that the group of close friends who had grown up under the Third Reich included a Jewish man was raised in the discussion programme as unlikely, and did feel like a dramatic contrivance at best to include the Jewish experience in its &quot;five friends&quot; conceit (but even then Generation War avoided showing the concentration camps).</p> <p>The &quot;war is hell&quot; message was very clear, but perhaps more emphasis could have been put on what was particularly terrible about this war and Germany's part in it, especially the visceral racial hatred that was only really hinted at by the woman who moved into Victor's parents' house and the SS officer who shot a little girl.</p> <p>I didn't think that the programme was trying to suggest that all partisans were anti-semitic, but if I were Polish I might well have felt indignant about that, and that point was well covered in the discussion programme afterwards.</p> <p>The cast was generally excellent, but I would pick out Friedhelm in particular, whose transformation from sensitive naif to nihilistic killer was incredibly well acted. Friedhelm was so damaged and had done such terrible things that there was no way back for him, and his &quot;suicide by Russians&quot; made emotional sense. By contrast, Greta had a rather underwritten final episode - all the big drama for her happened in episode 2, and the prison scenes didn't seem to add much.</p> <p>Was it perfect? No. Was it historically accurate? Probably not. But it was a gripping and absorbing TV drama, and the conversations it has sparked are interesting and important ones. If I have one complaint, it was that it shied away from the the most difficult issues - we never saw the concentration camps, we weren't really shown what it was that turned Nazi Germany into a byword for evil. Maybe that wasn't the story it set out to tell - but it could have done more there.</p>",

The point the reviewer makes is that these were not typical young people of the time. Even ZDF producer Benedict did not make the claim that the five young friends were typical, but only that such friendships (Germans and Jews in 1941) were just possible. The problem with this portrayal of everyone's 'mothers or fathers' was that exceptional people were shown to be representative of the young Germans of the day when they clearly were not..</p> <p>By contrast, we had the Polish partisans as types, not exceptions, and these types were almost exclusively anti-Semitic. ZDF has therefore taken the best Germans and presented them as typical and taken the worst Poles and presented those as typical. Fair? I don't think so.</p> <p>The scene with the freight cars and the AK (not sure if a spoiler alert is really necessry at this point, since this has been available on clips for many months) raises the following question:</p> <p>Viktor says: &quot;A co z nimi?&quot; (What about them?) &quot;Are they supposed to die like that?&quot;</p> <p>The partisan replies: &quot;Most of them are Jews. And Jews are as bad as communists or Russkies. Better dead than alive.&quot;</p> <p>So - the partisan is acknowledging that there may be some non-Jews on board. But since he hates Jews so much, he is willing to sacrifice even those individuals. </p> <p>No wonder the Polish ambassador called this scene &quot;absurd&quot;.Others have been far less charitable.</p>",

The Nazis depicted here come across&amp;nbsp; more or less like an alien race that invaded Germany rather than coming right out of the heart of the society which is simply a lie.&amp;nbsp; Accutally a bold lie.&amp;nbsp; Even in post war germany you didn't have to search to find Nazis that did not feel sorry within the educational system,&amp;nbsp; the jurisdiction,&amp;nbsp; the military or the police.&amp;nbsp; As late as 1978 one of my teachers at school very boldly expressed his views on school trips.&amp;nbsp; He wouldn't mind to sing the Horst Wessel Lied either as soon as he was drunk.&amp;nbsp; I am not saying this is Germany today rather the opposite but there seems to be an urge to paint Germans rather as victims within the post (!) war generation perfectly served by this series. The question to ask might be why are the&amp;nbsp; generations born since 1960 so keen to repaint history although&amp;nbsp; almost all of them are not sympathetic to Nazi Ideas? Maybe they just want to reduce the burden of history that rests upon their shoulders by simply being born in the wrong place.&amp;nbsp; Anyway its wrong and this series is an epic disasters I have to say although I am german.</p>",

Not because the chance meetings were not believable - even though they weren't - but because they were actually less dramatically powerful than if the friends had never met again (at least till after the war), or were shown to have almost been able to meet (for example one passes within a few miles of the other). </p> <p>The tragedy of war is that often people<i> don't </i>meet again. Last letters are sometimes delivered, but more often lost. Someone promises to carry a letter for another person, but then the letter carrier him/herself gets killed. Last farewells never reach the recipient. To me that is much more poignant in dramatic terms than dramatically- orchestrated 'meet ups'.</p>",

I believe the initial part of the story to be something approaching a Friends do Berlin approach but it seemed to me that after the initial part the programme attempted to be more historically correct. I enjoyed what i saw for TV watching but unlike a film i once witnessed about the White Rose in Munich University or from reading the book Alone in Berlin i could not feel the claustrophobic terror initiated by the Nazi regime and learnt nothing new in how regimes retain power when all around know ddep down somethings wrong. It seems im not alone after all!</p>",

As we currently have a monopoly on the dissemination of high culture in the UK, your opinion counts for nothing and it will end up where all the opinions of people we don't like belong, - in the dustbin of history! My daddy told me to say that.</p> <p>In addition, we are making a fortune from the sale of our TV programmes to Germany and if we had refused to purchase and screen <i>Generation War</i> our German friends would have been very upset. We are working in a very competitive, global TV industry and we purchased the series at a very good rate. </p> <p>Furthermore, the series stirred up much controversy. We knew it would. Stirring up controversy creates an amoral vacuum where we can have our cake and eat it. We get loads of attention, and money ! and if things get tough, we just put on a discussion programme at the end of the series to show we are fair and objective. Genius! </p> <p>Ultimately, all of us here at the BBC are Oxbridge educated so we know what the real sub-text of the series is. We realize the series depicted the Poles and Ukrainians as bigger anti-semites than the Germans. We also know that the German friends had a Jew in their midst whom they loved as much as themselves. </p> <p>Thus, 'Generation War' was essentially an apology for the holocaust from a country sick to death of this 'holocaust industry' that we are all having to read about the whole time. Holocaust this, holocaust that. Oy vey!<br />We can't stand it anymore. It reminds us of our own anti-semitic attitudes here in the UK. Come on, let's all be friends.</p> <p>Stop complaining and let us all 'move on.' And lastly, while we are at it, I still have £130,000 to pay on my mortgage for my flat in Notting Hill. If I start saying what I really think, I'll be out of a job.<br />PS Did you know, my flat is now worth £850,000?</p>",

Were none of these questions asked of their father when they made their farewells ? That is the unrealistic part at the very beginning.</p> <p>It is one thing to suggest that they were corrupted by the what they saw happening to civilians in RussIa , but the corruption had already been happening and the film in my view was flawed form the very beginning</p> <p>That said it would be simplistic to suggest the five young people were all guilty to an equal extent as members the Nazi Party, but neither would they have been as innocent of what what had been happening in Germany before the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 as the film seems to suggest.</p> <p>The two really fascinating questions to me is how a country , the land of Bach, Beethoven and Goethe succumbed to such evil which Hitler and the Nazi party created and could it have happened here if say Winston Churchill had been forced out of office in June 1940 following the fall of France-probably not for which we might thank Henry VIII who whatever his other faults ensured that antisemitism did not take root in this country as it did in Germany</p>",

In fact Austria-Hungary was the most dismembered party to the war and some of the countries such as Hungary felt just as diminished as Germany. The big difference is that Germany was still a very significant country in European politics and felt that its problems deserved addressing more than any other and what's more eventually had to means to do so hence the war.</p>",

Her mundanely terrifying execution upset me the most. Charly had sugar coated altruism but scatch underneath that thin sugar there lurked a cold hearted nazi. e.g the scene when she chillingly dismissed the local women assembled for a job. And the Russian Front seemed a very small place where folks kept bumping into each other all the time! I realize that was required to move the drama forward but still a bit clunky. The UK &amp; USA turned a blind eye to any former nazi they could re-use to build a stable new Germany or nuclear weapon! Overall a gripping tale and so long as accept it was not a documentary like The World AT War Series it did provide an insight into Germans history previously over looked. The all pervasive social claustrophobia of nazi Germany could have been teased out more but on the whole I am glad Wilhelm not Freidheim survived.</p>",

Most young people &quot;don't do politics&quot;, and doubly so if you'd been brainwashed while growing up in the Hitler Youth. The people who bear the real responsibility for Hitler are their elders; those who ought to have known better and did know better, particularly the generals.</p>",

I don't think it showed the characters as being in any way unaware or naive of what was going on around them - they were all well aware right at the start of what danger there was for Viktor - or of all being conveniently anti-Nazi, indeed some of them were shown to be very much subscribed to believing in the war and victory. And yet while at the same time sure, they had a Jewish friend, and sure they were naive in their attitudes towards the war and what it would involve, to say that those paradoxes are unrealistic is wrong. Those paradoxes are what make them ultimately human characters, in denial of the truths they want to conveniently ignore so they can try and carry on living their normal lives. Any drama that attempts to take on such a subject matter and allow it's characters to be actual human beings that we can't simply see as villains is making a big target of itself, but it's important that these things are tried because the reality isn't so conveniently black and white as &quot;all germans were bad guys&quot;.</p>",

Our children get educated about them and the Nazi era remains the most wide spread issue of the curricula. There is nothing unknown in Germany and nothing is hidden or forgotten.</p> <p>On this background, it was much more intensive to pick a group of bohemian, liberal and educated, metropolitan youths, than a group of Nazi ideologists.</p> <p>In this discussion the question was asked, whether it was plausible, to have a Jewish friend in such a group in spring 1941. Surely not the standard, but possible. At least not more impossible, as a mixed group of friends mixed from bohemian, educated liberals and enthusiastic Nazis would have been. </p> <p>One has to remember, that never, even at the highest point of &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot;, when party membership was more or less mandatory for career clerks and officials in any part of government and society, not more than 8 million Germans joined the NSDAP.<br />There remained millions of people who were communists, socialists, liberals, christdemocratic conservatives at heart, who couldn't speak out openly any more and even more millions of political uninterested people.</p> <p>On the other hand, summer 1941 was the absolute peak of the Nazi regime, the people had jobs, Poland and France were invaded in few weeks, the systematic extinction of the Jews had not yet begun and already practised war crimes were not commonly public. Even emphatic objectors of the Nazis started to think, that maybe not all they did was that wrong, in the light of their first successes.</p> <p>The point of the series was not to show, that maybe your father, your mother, was a Nazi party leader or a camp commander in Auschwitz. Most of them are known and were prosecuted, so their children normally know about their parents activities during the war. </p> <p>The point was, that even ordinary people, yet even cultivated and educated middle class bohemians, our beloved mothers and fathers, actively took part in, but also received, unimaginable gruesome and inhuman crimes during the war. </p> <p>How was this possible and why did they not want to speak about it? To protect themselves, to just forget, shame, because they thought it's to gruesome to involve their children?</p> <p>Not all actions of the series were representative or common, but all of them did happen somewhere, sometimes.<br />To pick just those aspects the authors did, was fully legitimate to construct a story for a series that intended to trigger German self reflection.</p> <p>Others may, or may be not allowed to generalize all WW2 Germans as monsters, we instead have to come clear with the monster in ourselves.</p>",

So here's my take.</p> <p>The main criticisms (both inside and outside Germany) were <br />1) the continued friendship in mid-1941 of young Germans with their Jewish childhood friend. I don't think this was the norm, but not improbable either: Goebbels for example complained in his diary that after years of state-run hate propanda, most Germans now had a healthy dislike of the evil, often foreign, often leftwing caricature Jews depicted by that propaganda, but many also made exceptions for their own Jews; the secular, patriotic and non-hooked-nosed German Jews they'd known all their livesm who'd fought in the Great War and who obviously didn't resemble the caricature Jews in any way. This feat of cognitive dissonance annoyed Goebbels a lot, but it's well attested.</p> <p>Most Jews were still living in their old homes at this time, and many of them clearly never believed it would get so bad as it did. Deportations didn't come until much later, and even then very few people knew what was happening. We can't use our hindsight to makelazy judgements here.</p> <p>2) Anti-Semitism of Poles. This caused a furore in Poland, but unfortunately it was true of a significant proportion of this deeply Catholic people. The German makers of the film perhaps missed an opportunity to present within the resistance group the full spectrum of Polish attitudes towards the Jews, which ranged from sympathy to hatred.</p> <p>3) The plot device of the characters repeatedly meeting by chance on the vast Russian front is just that: coincidences worthy of a Dickens novel. But this is drama, not a documentary, and otherwise the drama of five characters simply wouldn't work.</p> <p>4) Some critics say the Germans (including the four main protagonists) are shown too sympathetically. In fact they are all guilty of crimes of commission and omission, of betrayal. The other German characters shown, whether in Berlin or at the front, both male and female, are also shown in a fairly negative light. How can that be sympathetic treatment? </p> <p>All in all, this was a very nuanced and thought-provoking series, long overdue.</p>",

If you had taken the time to read some of the other comments, you might have noticed that one flaw with this series which was pointed out was that five unlikely (and likeable) friends had been presented as the norm in 1940s Germany ('Our mothers,our fathers'), at the same time as thoroughly unpleasant and viciously anti-Semitic thugs were presented as the Polish norm. Where's the Teutonic sense of Gerechtigkeit? As for Poland being a 'deeply Catholic country' - it wasn't always like that, you know. It only became much more Catholic after 1945 for obvious reasons...</p>",

And though terrible things &quot;did&quot; happen, that is not what happend, or was witnessed by every german there. Unluckily the show does say nothing if that guy was in Poland (or stationed on the French border, for example) and what he did there, so that is up for pure speculation. </p> <p>Also, the most disgusting crimes were done by command units that came behind the fighting units. And even though the regular Wehrmacht was involved in warcrimes in Poland from day one, it did not involve every single unit. After Poland the bulk of the Army was pulled to the western front in preperation of the invasion of France.</p> <p>What a lot of people miss is that the bloodiest chapters of the war and the Holocaust began only with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, the Holocaust after the Wannsee Conference in 1942. Before that, killings alrerady happend, but not to the degree and as widespread as in later years, so it's not as far fetched as you make it out to be that the people in 41 there were emotionally still rather intact. </p> <p>Finally, contrary to popular belief, Germans back then were not a monolithic society all brainwashed in Nazi ideology. Nazi support was wiedespread, but for some very different reasons amongst different people. Pretty much everybody had that one decent jew who was alright, looked alright and behaved alright, unlike the propaganda caricatures presented all the time. Is it unlikely they had such a jewish friend? yes? Impossible or implausible even? nope. </p> <p>These people were not stereotypical...but then, hardly anybody was. Some were worse, some were better. Look around in your own society today, you will see people with very different backgrounds and very different opinions, supporting parties, ideas, arguments for their very own reasons and interests. Some are more radical, some less, some do not hold an opinion at all towards certain topics. It was no different back then. </p> <p>The show ran outside the usual stereotypes and you have to see in the context of all the shows and movies done during the last 70 years that did not allow derivation from a very singular and one dimensional description of the Hitler fanatic as the typical german. This Propaganda, that never stopped after the war, itself has become such a common knowledge that it is interesting how much a more varied showing produces such disbelief. </p> <p>Btw, I am German. I had grandfathers. One was a hard core Nazi &quot;Bonze&quot; in Bavaria, the other was a Luftwaffe Officer from Northrhine Westphalia who served in France, Africa and Italy, commanding a FlaK battery. If you compare their stories and attitudes side by side, it was if both were living on different planets.</p>",

I don't mean to dismiss either your views or those of Wulfrunian (above) but as you can see, what particularly gets to me is the total caricature of the Polish resistance. As you might have guessed, I'm from a Polish background and I get fed up with Poles being stereotyped as moronic anti-Semites. That ZDF should have perpetuated this is particularly irksome, because what you say about their portrayal of ordinary Germans is mostly fair. No-one is saying that decent Germans didn't exist, but why make the Poles the nasty guys? It wasn't them who crossed the German border in September 1939.</p>",

Thumbs up!</p> <p>In regards to the polish collaboration...I honestly don't know about that one. I mean, no state can stay occupied for any lengh of time without serious collaboration by at least parts of any given population, without it there simply is no way to maintain an occupation. But I never read anything in particular towards the polish situation here, I have to admit.</p>",
