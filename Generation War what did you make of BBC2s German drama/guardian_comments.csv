1,WHYCOMMENT,12 May 2014 1:29pm,30,True,"Ok, I’ll get the ball rolling with some thoughts.. I am Jewish, born in the uk 1960, and have always had an emotional response to the Germans and their conduct in the second world war.  Whilst I believe that there were a lot of evil people in Germany during the war, such that there was a kind of “collective guilt”, I have also believed that you can not blame an entire nation, nor their children. With that in mind I watched this with great interest I watched and was actually captivated by it. I think I even enjoyed it! Germany was portrayed as a horrible place to live, especially for the “ordinary “people who must have been conflicted. Each brother seemed to know he’d lost his soul and his humanity and I guess it must have been difficult to resist the pressure to fit in. Humans readily accept the norm as being ok.And yet, most Germans did go along with things and you do wonder how much they succumbed to this –eg the family that took the flat of the Jewish family that was featured, readily took on the anti –Semitic stance of the regime with apparent ease. Perhaps there was a “German mentality” which is a phrase that I have heard used many times. So my conclusion is that this was a programme worth watching addressing difficult issues, that did not deny what a terrible place Germany must have been and that there was a cost to the country and its people. As a drama it felt well put together too. What it possibly could have addressed was the role that the German opposition took throughout Nazi rule took and if it had support, however passive, amongst the people."

I doubt there were more inherently evil people in Germany than in England - surely the point is that given the right conditions and the right prompting human beings will become what we like to think of as inhuman. So many times we have seen this all over the world - surely I don't need to start listing examples. In fact, I think it's dangerous to start throwing around the idea that these things occur because of a preponderance of inherently evil people, as if the people there at the time were qualitatively different to ourselves, because it lulls us into a false sense of security that it couldn't happen here, All you need, for example, is economic hardship, a relatively defenceless minority and cynical racist politicians with no qualms about exploiting the situation to gain power and inflict suffering on &quot;the other&quot;. Suddenly the scenario doesn't seem so alien, does it........"
3,crisscross,12 May 2014 4:58pm,4,False,"Indeed, the interesting thing is how the Nazi ideology got a grip on the mentality of Germans at that time. Clearly, there was nothing unique about the Germans, just that historical circumstances were such that this awful barbarity took hold in an advanced and cultured nation. The rise of the Nazis should indeed be seen as a warning from history. My objection to Generation War is that it paints a false picture of innocence among a group of young Germans, who on the one hand are portrayed as fully supporting Hitler and the war (at the start at least) and on the other as being innocent of the true nature of Hitler's regime. Totally unbelievable!"
4,straighttalkingjack,12 May 2014 5:05pm,1,False,"Quite, the fact that it could happen anywhere is no reason not to judge harshly those who go along with the cruelty and barbarism."
5,IlikeBrits,12 May 2014 9:58pm,2,False,It is really remarkable for me that it seems that persons with jewish background are very often the more fair judges than the self-satisfied would have been heroes.
6,SolarTime2012,17 May 2014 2:15am,1,False,And its not the only film its a miniseries so it has soap opera elementswhile a film like SOPHIE SCHOLL The Final Days is a feature with an intense atmosphere that makes you really feel the blanket of the ideology. BLURAY is superb.
7,ChewingTheCud,19 May 2014 8:15am,2,False,"My objection to Generation War is that it paints a false picture of innocence among a group of young Germans, who on the one hand are portrayed as fully supporting Hitler and the war (at the start at least) and on the other as being innocent of the true nature of Hitler's regime. Totally unbelievable!  Very relevantly Goebbels said that a lie repeated often enough becomes the truth. Jews are non-people, cockroaches, money grabbers, the enemy of the Reich.   Tell the world that the sun goes around the earth and you're believed, just because you have no proof to the contrary and everybody thinks it's true. The facts are often unobtainable or buried under repetition. Very relevantly again, today people attempt to tell us that Israel is apartheid. It is not, but we are told this so often that it becomes a meme, is accepted and grows and eventually it is a truth we pass on."
8,ChewingTheCud,19 May 2014 8:20am,1,False,I doubt there were more inherently evil people in Germany than in England   Indeed. Many on the self-hating radical extreme left supported Hitler's non-agression pact with Stalin. What base hypocrisy from those who claim 'moral supremacy' but are actually in the gutter.
9,Fionnbarra61,12 May 2014 1:36pm,11,False,"I will watch it again, that's for sure. An excellent study of what it may have been like to live in the shadow of the Third Reich and compelled if not coerced into it's nefarious purpose...Superb TV really... For a parallel see Dan Snow's excellent piece on the East India Company - albeit a century earlier but the notion of racial superiority as a highly dangerous construct was well displayed.... Well done to the production team and cast."
10,User995975,12 May 2014 1:40pm,7,False,They had a debate after the show.&amp;nbsp; The Polish ambassador said the show should not have portrayed the resistance fighters as anti semite.&amp;nbsp; Pity he didn't know much about his countrymen's well documented anti semitism.
11,daisydill,12 May 2014 1:51pm,10,False,"The day before World War 2 ended, my father and his comrades in the Polish Forces were &quot;our gallant Allies, the Poles&quot;. The day after they were &quot;fascist thugs&quot;. In &quot;When a Crocodile Eats the Sun&quot;, Peter Godwin writes movingly of the political betrayal suffered by his father and mine: &quot;In the summer of 1946, the huge victory parade takes place down the Mall in London. Two million onlookers cheer wildly as King George V1 takes the salute from Allied soldiers of dozens of nations. In the skies overhead there is a massive fly-past. but though they are the fourth biggest Allied army, no Polish forces march that day. The new Warsaw regime, at Stalin's insistence, ignores its British invitation and stays away. And the Free Poles have not been invited. Anyway, they have nothing to celebrate. While everyone else is jubilant, many of them watch the victory parade in tears.&quot;The new Polish government said we were traitors, just a bunch of fascist thugs, and I realized I would never be able to go home to Poland&quot;. says my father. &quot;And Cania, who had stayed behind with our unit in Germany, after I'd been sent back for officer training, realized the same thing. He couldn't bear it. He walked out of his tent one evening and shot himself&quot;. In the wake of the war, Poland was betrayed and handed over to Stalin, and it seems we have been vilified ever since. Apparently we feature as &quot;baddies&quot; in this TV programme (which I haven't seen). We have had a good lesson in the wisdom of staying neutral, I will say that. The countries that managed to do so did not suffer as Poland did, nor do they come in for this constant vilification."

13,JosefSvejk,12 May 2014 1:55pm,8,False,"How about their well-documented &quot;toleration&quot;, which accounts for the fact that so many Jews were living in Poland in the first place? A complex issue, I merely wish to point out."
14,StuartRG,12 May 2014 2:10pm,11,False,"That's over simplification. There were anti Semitic pogroms in Poland even after the war, as well as some hostility to the Jews before and during - dont forget Poland was a military dictatorship and even took a small piece of Czechoslovakia in 1938. But that doesn't mean the whole country was anti semitic and comparable to the Nazis..  A lot of the British Establishment were at least warm to the Nazis - including The Observer. Anti semitism thrived in Europe and the USA. It was extremely widespread, and yet there were many in all countries who wanted to help the Jews. Its extremely complicated and cannot really be portrayed in such a short TV series."
15,MatthiasS,12 May 2014 3:30pm,4,False,"The history of the Free Poles is indeed a sad and tragic one. But I don't really get your point. &quot;Vililfied&quot; ever since by whom?  Plus, neutrality wouldn't have helped Poland at all (like it helped Switzerland during those times). Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union would have attacked it no matter if it is a neutral country or not. I can understand why many Polish people after all the country went though in the last century feel a deep mistrust towards foreign powers, Russia and Germany of course, but also Western powers who didn't really helped them. But still: Sometimes I have the impression that many Polish people are way too much invested in their country#s role as the eternal victim. Yes, Poland suffered terribly, but the way you commemorate it turns everything into an idealised and glorified myth of tragic heroism."
16,daisydill,12 May 2014 3:47pm,4,False,"Hello Matthais, I realise that Poland was in pretty much an impossible position at the time with Hitler and Stalin happily working together to invade and occupy it. But I think the lesson to be learnt is to do all we can to stay out of these wars. I don't think that Poland's history, while sad, is a history of tragic heroism. Does anyone think that? The 20th Century was tragic for Poland, but so it was for many peoples. And the horrors go on worldwide to this day. And actually all history is sad if you come to think of it. Like most peoples lives seems sad, seen in retrospect. At the moment &quot;all creation is groaning together and being in pain together&quot;.  Being vilified... well, judging from the review above we appear as villains, not as heroic freedom fighters. Its very different from the way that, for example, the French resistance is usually portrayed. Why? And the re-defining of Nazi concentration camps as &quot;Polish&quot; has become so widespread that three British MPs actually issued a press release protesting it. It said, in part: “The location of most of these camps by Nazi Germany in what was thenoccupied Poland does not justify the description &quot;Polish&quot;. We do notrefer to ancient amphitheatres in France as &quot;French&quot; but as &quot;Roman&quot;;we do not refer to the Krak des Chevaliers castle in Syria as a&quot;Syrian&quot; but as a &quot;Crusader&quot; fortress; we do not refer to the formercolonial slave forts in Ghana as &quot;Ghanaian&quot; but as &quot;British&quot;; we donot refer to Guantanamo Bay camp in Cuba as &quot;Cuban&quot; but as &quot;U.S.&quot;. Ineach case the symbol of oppression is associated by its descriptionwith the perpetrator and not the territory in which it is currentlysited.” And I have never seen the notorious Japanese POW camps described as other than &quot;Japanese&quot;, though they were sited in various different countries. I have to wonder why the rules change when it comes to Poland? I am not obsessive about it - just noting it."
17,User874788,12 May 2014 4:01pm,5,False,"And a pity that you don't know much about the 1,000 years of Jewish history in Poland which is well-documented but ignored by the media. This includes immigration of Jews from England (and Spain, Portugal, etc.) because of the persecution against them in those countries and the tolerant policies of the Poles. As for the Polish resistance, they were the only organization in occupied Europe to have an organization -- ZEGOTA -- exclusively for the aid of Jews."
18,User874788,12 May 2014 4:15pm,5,False,"There were anti-Semitic pogroms throughout Soviet-occupied Eastern Europe after the war: e.g. four in Czechoslovakia, and in Hungary, four in Budapest alone. There were also anti-Jewish riots in the UK in 1948. Somehow, only the incident in Poland is publicised."
19,Ruelan,12 May 2014 9:40pm,0,False,Apparently we feature as &quot;baddies&quot; in this TV programme   No you dont.
20,mokit,12 May 2014 10:21pm,3,False,thank you for sharing that
21,Bangorstu,13 May 2014 6:04am,1,False,"The 20th Century was tragic for Poland, but so it was for many peoples.   Name me another country that lost 20% of its population in 5 years... Rwanda maybe, but that's it. The Poles were right to be annoyed as the ONLY anti-Semitic characters to spend much time on screen - apart from fleeting shots of the SS - were Polish. Many Poles were anti-Semitic (quite a few returning camp survivors were murdered) but most weren't, as evidenced by the fact 20,000 Jews survived the war in Warsaw."
22,daisydill,13 May 2014 7:30am,1,False,Thanks for understanding Bangorstu. Poles are no better - or no worse - than anybody else - but they did actually fight on the Allied Side during WW2.
23,StuartRG,13 May 2014 11:08am,0,False,"Yes there were pogroms in other countries, as I alluded to. I wasn't picking on Poland, I was just following the Polish theme in the point I replied to."
24,Bangorstu,13 May 2014 7:30pm,1,False,Since someone else mentioned it - the piece of Czechoslovakia which the Poles nabbed in 1938 was full of ethnic Poles. Woodrow Wilson hardly covered himself in glory in creating that nation.
25,BlutoBlutarsky,16 May 2014 1:22pm,1,False,"What about the not-so-well-documented villagers and townspeople murdered for sheltering Jews? Or the not-so-well-documented Jewish soldiers fighting in the ranks of the Polish army? Or the not-so-well-documented hundreds of Jewish officers who were massacred along with Christian Poles at Katyn? Or the not so well-publicized reluctance of certain high-profile people in the West to believe the Polish resistance when they brought stories of the mass-killing of the Jews? I would read up a bit about the AK, if I were you. You may not realize, but the organization included Jewish fighters as well."

27,bonbonniera,19 May 2014 7:35am,0,False,"The Polish ambassador said the show should not have portrayed the resistance fighters as anti semite  I do hope that someone who knew some history put him and the audience, right."
28,BlutoBlutarsky,19 May 2014 11:53am,0,False,"The ambassador described the scene with the freight cars as &quot;absurd&quot; and it was exactly that. We were being asked to believe that the Polish resistance hated Jews so much that they were willing to abandon them to die in the full knowledge that there may have been Christians among them. Remember the dialogue? &quot;Most of them are Jews, etc&quot;. &quot;Absurd&quot; is actually an understatement. &quot;Mendacious&quot;, &quot;misleading&quot;, &quot;tendentious&quot;, &quot;inaccurate&quot; might have been more appropriate. Take your pick. No-one is saying that there were no anti-Semitic Poles, but it wasn't the Poles who were responsible for &quot;the final solution&quot;, so why make them appear more inherently anti-Semitic than the Germans themselves? The portrayal of the resistance leader as marginally more humane than the rest of the bunch was an extremely small sop to Polish sensibilities."
29,BlutoBlutarsky,19 May 2014 12:03pm,0,False,"The ambassador called the scene with the freight cars &quot;absurd&quot; and it was exactly that. Why? Because we were asked to believe that the Polish resistance hated Jews so much that they were willing to let them perish in the closed cars in the full knowedge that there may have been non-Jews among them. (Remember the dialogue? &quot;Most of them are Jews, etc&quot;) Other Polish viewers may have thought that the term &quot;absurd&quot; was an understatement.  And the portrayal of the resistance leader as marginally more humane than the rest of the bunch (but still an anti-Semite) was an extremely small sop to Polish sensibilities."
30,BlutoBlutarsky,19 May 2014 12:05pm,0,False,I just said that. What is this? Am I being shadowed by some kind of Doppelganger?
31,MikeRichards,12 May 2014 1:40pm,20,False,"I really enjoyed it. A shame it didn't get more promotion leading up to the broadcast, and typically for the BBC they managed to schedule it after an overrunning game of snooker, so I'm sure some people missed the rather crucial second part. As for the content, I'm with WHYCOMMENT above, the programme didn't flinch from showing how Nazism compromised everyone, no matter how noble their intent or otherwise. No matter if you took a principled stance against the war, or if you colluded with the regime, it destroyed you. And production quality wise - once again our European neighbours are showing the BBC how good television can look when you spend some time and effort on it."

A shame it didn't get more promotion leading up to the broadcast, and typically for the BBC they managed to schedule it after an overrunning game of snooker, so I'm sure some people missed the rather crucial second part.   Yes, completely missed this one. No series catchup on iPlayer either, just the last episode and the debate available."
33,RougeTrooper,12 May 2014 1:52pm,6,False,"I think the problem with the series was that it was not based on a book (unlike Band of Brothers)... but built from the 'ground up' for TV, it used ludicrous situations over and over again, preferring the 'drama' over the historical each time. The final straw, for me, was the very end with false dates given for the characters, reinforcing the pretense that these were real people, and so their stories were real. I think it was a bit of a mess, really; presenting fiction as factual, and deserved much of the criticism it's received. Better to have been a drama, and not have tried to represent itself as that generation's experience of the war."
34,yealandRed,12 May 2014 3:58pm,3,False,"I completely agree with the dates of the character's deaths. They did not earn the right to create such a false history, and a causal viewer tuning in could have been confused by this. If the drama had gone on beyond the war years it could have made sense. The again Fargo claims to be a true story..."
35,justlittleoldme,12 May 2014 6:25pm,1,False,"Isn't it the license of the dramatist to create the stories? Do you have the same problem with historical novels that do the exact same thing? After all, historical novels are both fiction and non-fiction in one, just as Generation War is, and it's not always easy to distinguish between the two. But as with good historical novels, good historical dramas involve a significant amount of research that goes into creating a story. Ok, so it's not going to be perfect and it's not going to be error free, but no retelling of anything is perfect. Let's not forget Stephen Ambrose's penchant for...embellishment. Does that diminish the impact of Band of Brothers? I know it doesn't for me, but really, where do we draw the line in how we retell history?"
36,RougeTrooper,12 May 2014 7:09pm,0,False,"Indeed, but before this mini-series we've had The Pianist and (from Germany) Downfall /i&gt; as movies, @justlittleoldme. Are Germans saying that this, fictional, story of 'five friends' (one of which happens to be Jewish), explains what happened to young Germans in 1941-45? IMHO, The Pianist, in much less screen time, delivered a much more nuanced and credible account of the Nazi-German war against the Jews and other untermensh launched in September 1939 when Hitler chose to invade Poland. Very simply, Germans ended up suffering in WWII, but only after they'd made others suffer a war that a majority of them agreed with, as pay-back for WWI."
37,RougeTrooper,12 May 2014 7:18pm,1,False,"The again Fargo claims to be a true story... RougeTrooper   That's a joke, in both the film and the TV series... AFAIK Fargo (in either interation) is not claiming to try to explain how weird Minnesota is, say compared to Florida, or Texas. ;)"
38,justlittleoldme,12 May 2014 9:50pm,1,False,"Well, given that The Pianist was about a Jew in hiding in Warsaw, and Downfall was about the final days within Hitler's bunker, they are hardly decent comparisons to Generation War. Different elements of the story of WWII, yes, but other than that I'm not entirely sure why you've brought them up?  And I personally don't think Generation War IS about the &quot;Nazi-German war against the Jews and other[s]&quot;. And in many ways that's the beauty of it. We think WWII and we think Hitler and Holocaust. But Generation War challenges us to look beyond that, to look at other aspects of the war. I don't think the writers of Generation War were looking for the perfect explanation, and they certainly weren't making apologies. They were bringing another aspect of the war to life, and yes, license was needed. But just because it's not centred on the Holocaust or Hitler doesn't make it disingenuous. And I really don't know if the majority of Germans agreed with the war as payback for WWI, but I would be surprised if that were accurate. Also, even if a majority thought it was good, it doesn't encompass all. And 51% in favour still means 49% are not."
39,RougeTrooper,12 May 2014 10:43pm,0,False,"Well, given that The Pianist was about a Jew in hiding in Warsaw, and Downfall was about the final days within Hitler's bunker, they are hardly decent comparisons to Generation War.   Having seen both before watching it, I thought they were. In The Pianist Germans, Poles and/or Jews are all people... in Downfall we see Germans telling the story of the horror of the collapse of the Nazi-German regime. IMO, especially as titled Unsere Mütter, Unsere Väter in German, the series was both provocative and flawed as an attempt to explain to some Germans why they suffered and became victims in WWII."
40,justlittleoldme,12 May 2014 10:49pm,0,False,"true. i think i just misread your earlier comment.  and i concur - provocative and flawed, but what good piece of work isn't both?"
41,RougeTrooper,12 May 2014 11:32pm,0,False,"provocative and flawed, but what good piece of work isn't both?   Yeah, but Hitler and the Third Reich was the sort of street-theatre we'd expect the German police to stop, unless they were bearing a grudge from the defeat of Germany in WWI. Can't we now, at least agree, Germany lost WWI without its shell-shocked and starving army being subjected to the humiliation of the British, French and USA actually invading and conquering Germany?"
42,justlittleoldme,12 May 2014 11:38pm,0,False,nope.

45,IlikeBrits,13 May 2014 9:47pm,1,False,My German is a little bit too clumsi to argue on the same level with Tataumlives but I am glad that you uncover him as that what he is. A guy who does not have the ability to develop a single idea. He also seems to be a somehow lose gun and one could be glad not to meet him in real life. It is a pleasure to follow your analyses and and the clear reasoning. He does not even get that you give him a lesson for free.
46,RougeTrooper,18 May 2014 10:20pm,0,False,"Because i do not agree with you.   You'll be familiar that in the UK many people of many nations helped us help defeat Hitler... for example, black-Brits from Jamaica (and elsewhere) served as RAF aircrew in RAF Bomber Command, not merely when the RAF's bombers mass-murdered Nazi-German civilians. FFS, the USAAF unleashed black pilots in P-51s, with drop-tanks, to seek targets of opportunity if Nazi-Germany couldn't put up fighters to challenge Allied air-supremacy!"
47,bonbonniera,19 May 2014 7:32am,2,False,"Isn't it the license of the dramatist to create the stories?  Television that presents the news in story form (actually called 'stories') has the power to rewrite history. To people who know very little of the reality a sweeter gentler version of WW2 Germany is very acceptable, since Germany is a friend today.  However forgetting the lesson of the horror of the Holocaust Reich is dangerous in that it blinds us to strong indications that still exist. Antisemitism &amp; race hatred did not vanish magically. We should remember what they did so that we do not fall into the same traps again."
48,pipdog,12 May 2014 1:53pm,6,False,"Saw the scene where the friends met up in a bar in the first episode. Were we seriously expected to believe that a Jewish youth in 1941, knowing what was happening to his people, would still be bemoaning the fact that he couldn't fight for Germany?

49,InFlanders,12 May 2014 2:09pm,2,False,"Were we seriously expected to believe that a Jewish youth in 1941, knowing what was happening to his people, would still be bemoaning the fact that he couldn't fight for Germany   I agree entirely. Even in countries occupied by Germany - let alone Germany itself - Jews were suffering badly under Nazi occupation. Hence, for example, the response of the Dutch people to round ups of Jews in Amsterdam as early as February 1941 with a national strike."
50,InFlanders,12 May 2014 2:18pm,7,False,"Were we seriously expected to believe that a Jewish youth in 1941, knowing what was happening to his people, would still be bemoaning the fact that he couldn't fight for Germany   Exactly. And for an eye-witness account of the events of Kristallnacht, as far back as 1938, this:    The object of the mob's hate was a hospital for sick Jewish children, many of them cripples or consumptives. In minutes the windows had been smashed and the doors forced. When we arrived, the swine were driving the wee mites out over the broken glass, bare-footed and wearing nothing but their nightshirts. The nurses, doctors, and attendants were being kicked and beaten by the mob leaders, most of whom were women.   or this from Daily Telegraph reporter Hugh Greene:    Mob law ruled in Berlin throughout the afternoon and evening and hordes of hooligans indulged in an orgy of destruction. I have seen several anti-Jewish outbreaks in Germany during the last five years, but never anything as nauseating as this. Racial hatred and hysteria seemed to have taken complete hold of otherwise decent people. I saw fashionably dressed women clapping their hands and screaming with glee, while respectable middle-class mothers held up their babies to see the &quot;fun&quot;."
51,IlikeBrits,12 May 2014 10:12pm,5,False,"The Jews in Germany did not regard themselves as The Jews. They regarded themselves as Germans not as Jewish people in general. Their fathers and grandfarthers fought for Germany of Prussia. So it is not impossible that there were Jewish Germans who still were German patriots although they were treated very, very bad and killed at least."
52,Lintflas,12 May 2014 10:26pm,3,False,"Were we seriously expected to believe that a Jewish youth in 1941   Yes, you were expected to believe it because it was historically accurate. After the war ended in 1945 there were still more than 5000 Jews living in Berlin alone.Unlike US/UK movie makers Germans usually tend to make accurate and realistic war movies based on actual evidence and circumstances instead of bias and propaganda."
53,Lintflas,12 May 2014 10:29pm,1,False,The Telegraph is famous for it's anti-German propaganda to the present day. I'm so sure if that is a reliable source.

Because, under Hitler, Berlin was declared to be a 'Jew-free' city, in a 'Jew-free' country... a grandious claim that collapsed in the face of Allied and Soviet forces, with Jews serving in them, entering Nazi-German territory even as the SS staged the 'death-marches' against their prisoner-enemies that were at risk of being liberated."
55,Bangorstu,13 May 2014 6:40pm,1,False,"Quite a few were hidden, or hid themselves. One Jewish person survived by joining the SS... on the grounds that's the last place anyone would look. What is unlikely is someone being openly Jewish. That Jews would be patriotic is however reasonable - quite a few went to the camps wearing their WW1 medals."
56,InFlanders,14 May 2014 5:01pm,1,False,Hugh Carlton Greene was one of our greatest journalists. The way you malign him out of sheer ignorance is breath-taking. But ignorance of facts is clearly no barrier to expressing opinions blt - or getting recommended for them by others equally unknowledgeable.

59,Tataumlives,12 May 2014 1:53pm,8,False,"As they said on the panel discussion there was something almost ahistorical about the characters and the idea odrinary Germans could fraternise openly with Jews in Germany by 1941, when most Jews had already been forced to emigrate or been round up into camps or transported eastward to the new ghettoes in Poland. The few who hadn't immigrated or yet been deported would have had a miserable experience left behind of being permanently abused and spat at and it's simply not plausible that they could have partaken of a scene of carefree fun at the opening of the film. Besides that I believe it was a serious offence for Jews to go anywhere without wearing a yellow star. The makers simply went too far to make the characters likeable to a modern young audience and to suggest that the corruption began with the war and not before is also taking the license to dangerous excess. Most Germans were already heavily indoctrinated and identified fervently with the Nazi system, its goals and its virulent hatred and persecution of the Jews. I was outraged by the writer who said they have 'no responsiblity' to portray history accurately. Writers should be given the right to take liberties with history for dramatic license, but when you're dealing with a topic like the Nazis and the Holocaust you have to tread carefully or you risk stepping over into revisionism, intentional or not, and I think this went close. In the film Starship Troopers we're given a fascinating albeit tongue-in-cheek portrayal of a Nazi-like society where everyone - even the audience - is invited to identify with a fascist system and the characters, who just accept their behaviour and the way society is ordered as normal. That portrayal of a fascist psychology was in many ways a more accurate, seductive and subversive depcition of life in a Nazi society was like than the admittedly enjoyable but unreal fantasy of Generation War. Despite its powerful dramatic impact I don't think history will be kind to this series."
60,Enheduanna,12 May 2014 2:09pm,17,False,"The yellow star was compulsory for Jews after 19 September 1941, so it was possible that they did not have to wear it before (at the start of the series I think it is the spring of 1941). As for the friendship between them, the point of drama is to show what could happen, not what did happen. As Pirandello once remarked, reality will always beat the most fervent imagination. I think by criticising the friendship between the five young people, including one Jew, people are not criticising its improbability, but its function in humanising them. To an extent, this is a device, to make their eventual downfall and loss of innocence even more dramatic. And I think this is the point: people do not want to accept that these young Germans were innocent to start with, or in any way victims of the regime. But to an extent they were; they had grown up within Nazism and had known nothing else. The fact that they had preserved a certain amount of humanity and idealism, seems too much for most viewers who either want to cling on to the fiction that all Germans were guilty monsters, or want to stress their inhumanity to better distance themselves from them."
61,Fionnbarra61,12 May 2014 2:20pm,18,False,"I think you may be wrong about history being unkind to this series. I believe it is historical fact that there was an opposition in Germany and many who pursued it's cause paid for it with their lives. It is a frightfully complex subject but I believe this depiction portrays ordinary flawed individuals caught up in an extreme collective madness...until the truth hits them.  Britain, for all it's worthy liberalism was the largest drug dealer in history and caused the deaths of countless millions from Ireland to India via famine, war and basic neglect. The sense of British superiority has obviously waned of late but let's not kid ourselves that the Nazis were unique. Think US policy in Vietnam, Soviet treatment of the Kulaks, Turkish oppression of Armenia, Serb atrocities in Srebrenica, the genocide in Rwanda.....all fostered by a sense of superiority. This series has humanised some of the thought processes behind Germany's descent into madness and it is to it's credit that it doesn't pull too many punches. Let's hope for our children and grandchildren we will never witness it's like again."

But to an extent they were; they had grown up within Nazism and had known nothing else.   I think that could be argued about Germans in the period 1933-36, but not by 1941. There's also the question of how representative would this group have been of young Germans, and by picking out what would have been a highly unusual and extraordinary group who had 'preserved their humanity' it is arugably distorting our perception of the reality of Germany by that time. As I've noted below the mass of evidence suggests the vast of majority of Germans, and in particular the young, were enthusiastic supporters of the regime and its goals and participated willingly even revelling in atrocities, and were not under duress to do so as the film suggests."

We are still asking them to carry a collective responsibility in a way that is peculiar and special to these events. I hate to remind you all of this, but the British Empire is collectively responsible of many more deaths than Nazi Germany ever managed (please check out &quot;Late Victorian Holocausts' by Mike Davis http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jan/20/historybooks.famine), but nobody expects James Ivory productions to portait young upper class English as irremediably corrupted by Victorian propaganda about the 'civilising' nature of the Empire.

You and the poster before demonstrate this dangerous tendency to relativse these crimes and lump them with others as much of a muchness that ends up apportioning blame for such crimes equally as this series has attempted to do. In particular your attempt to equate Nazi genocide and its war of annihilation in Russia with ‘US policy in Vietnam’ is quite simply offensive and a good example of the glib and facetious historical parallels that warped interpretations of history like this provoke.  Apart from the fact that the Vietnam War mobilized enormous opposition across US society from its outset, not least among the youth and the media, and which was one of the main reasons for the US decision to ultimately deescalate and withdraw. That was something totally inconceivable in Nazi Germany, where ordinary Germans fought to the bitter end for Hitler’s criminally insane regime, sending children to die in suicide attacks, a perverse paradox this series unfortunately doesn’t begin to explain."

The fact remains that the opposition - heroic or not - was largely ineffecitve and the main reason it was so ineffective was because the vast majority of Germans remained solidly behind Hitler right up to the very end. As for the 20,000 who were executed by the courts, most of those were for quite mundane 'crimes', such as expressing simple discontent and disgruntlement or making fun of the Nazi leadership, taking more food than they were entitled too, or profiteering and other such wartime offences and can in no way be interpreted as a groundswell of opposition to Hitler, and certainly not as examples of fearless opposition to the regime.

Read the court reports if you don't believe me, the German statute books were bulging with minor offences that earned the death penalty, but that still doesn't make them opponents of the regime, if anything it shows agains how slavishly servile and subservient Germans became to the most brutally extreme and indiscriminately violent regime in history. An excellent account is provided in the book Furchtbare Juristen which also demonstrates the degree to which the German legal profession whored itself to the regime and rode roughshod over their own professional and legal ethics in their obsequious determination to please Hitler's henchman, not least in the drafting of the Nuremberg Laws and their extension to occupied Eastern Europe.

Not forgettting numerous polls taken after the war that showed continued and overwhelming support and approval for the Nazi regime and their 'achievements'. Have you any evidence to disprove the authenticity of this material apart from your own blatantly extremist political views that dismisses it out of hand?

There have been endless documentaries on hitler this and hitler that on German TV in the past. Maybe these should be shown on the BBC and we could discuss these in detail. No, I think the intention was to just show a present day German audience in a somewhat convoluted and sepia tinged way something of what &quot;our mothers and fathers&quot; did or didn't do. And to an extent it did just that.  I watched this on German TV with my father who was 14 at the end of the war. He lived in a small rural town. He only spoke about his youth when asked but watching this series opened quite a flood of memories for him and I am grateful I was there to listen. He feels tremendous guilt and regret. And no, he was not involved in the hitler youth, had to help on the farm. He has memories of various things, incl. people raiding the ware house of Jewish owned meat canning factory and seeing two men hanged. He was not involved in any of this and neither were his family but of course they did nothing to stop it. His only &quot;war action&quot; was being put into uniform with a gun in April 45 to defend the town - together with other school kids. When he was confronted by a member of the approaching US army and was able to tell them his name and age in his school English, they send him home. He said that this past will never leave us and he said that he has carried this shame with him all is life, this shame and this enormous feeling of guilt that he as a boy trusted and looked up to people - his teachers in school, his parents, his older brothers and cousins - who really must have known what was going on and who did nothing. He trusted them and accepted their judgement. He was healthy and young, he could read and ask. How could he have been so ignorant, so stupid and so inactive. There was little or no talk about the war during my childhood. I used to be outraged by this silence and used every opportunity to confront and to argue - still do. My father was not someone who would give out rules, but he was adamant about one thing, never join a crowd, stay away from the masses. Question authority, he always preached and we would yawn. I wonder how many other families in Germany had similar discussions after watching."

Kershaw's work including the Hitler, the Germans and the Final Solution  and Nazi Dictatorship and his recent The End  about the last months of the war, deal specifically about the knowledge and involvement of ordinary Germans in the Holocaust and why the Germans fought to the bitter end.

95,justlittleoldme,13 May 2014 11:33am,1,False,"and to get back to why i don't want you to point me to that book (aside from you already mentioned it in an earlier thread) - my main problem with this is that you seem to transpose the attitudes of german POWs - german soldiers in extreme circumstances in which we must recognise contextual impact - you take those attitudes and you transpose them onto ordinary german citizens. you note that the legal profession broke down, but you claim it's because of selfish greed or ideological fervour, which i'm sure was the case for some, if not many, of those within the profession, but you then get defensive when someone suggests that maybe the breakdown of governance, or even fear, were factors. for me, i would see the breakdown of a liberal legal sector as a problem of governance first and foremost - it was a consequence of the regime itself and most likely would've taken place regardless of the individuals working within it. unless, of course, they were incredibly brave individuals who stood up and said no. sadly, from the records available, we know that those who did stand up and say no were some of the first victims. we have to take that into account - that element of fear - when assessing societal 'acceptance' or 'complacency' (and i use those words loosely and with caution). there is no single simple answer here - there is no uniform response, excuse or explanation - and to claim that there is, well, it means that you're denying the complexity of the situation and looking for an easy answer. you've found your easy enemy and your simplified villain and you're sticking to it. that may be fine for you, but it is not fine for me. neither of us know what living under a dictator is like, but i'm guessing i have a bit of a better understanding of what it could be like than you do, and i recognise that choice is one of the first things often lost. i also recognise that in situations like that, and in situations in which people beat the drum so much that they begin to believe it (not uncommon in what turn out to be genocides - brainwashing, if you will), you cannot say &quot;that person believes that&quot; because it is so much more complex than that. i don't know, this has turned into a bit of a ramble, but really, it's hard to know where to begin with people who take such a simplified and one-track view of the world around them and of history."
96,Tataumlives,13 May 2014 11:39am,1,False,"history is subjective and a large part of it is story telling.   A very dangerous and dubious assertion to make, implying that the testimony of everyone is equally valid and we should make no value judgements not even between victim and perpetrator. The raw material may be subjective, the historian's analysis should never be and one of the hallmarks of Kershaw's work for which he's been praised is the astonishing distance and dispassionate handling of such an emotive topic, but which does not diminish the horror of what he describes. You’re right though, you’re not a historian: a historian’s job is to bring together the different accounts, testimonies and statements and strip away the subjectivity and falsehood to provide us with an understanding and context to make it comprehensible especially events like WWII and the Holocaust, something Nietzel has done brilliantly in Soldaten and for which Kershaw has been acclaimed for in his works on the Third Reich, neither of which btw claim to be the last word on their subjects, but are nonetheless the most current and authorative works of genuine scholarship that are clearly lost on you."
97,justlittleoldme,13 May 2014 11:48am,1,False,"yeah, i think we're going to have to agree to disagree on this one. history is subjective by its very nature. a historian CAN attempt to strip it away, but subjectivity lies in analysis, no matter who you are. even history and historical analysis is underpinned by theoretical approach. to deny subjectivity in that is to show a misunderstanding of the discipline. yes, you can have historians that paint a more balanced picture than others, but a completely unsubjective historian would be a truly rare find indeed. i am, however, curious as to how you've derived your own expertise on understanding what history and the historian are. my love of history comes from holding a few degrees in the subject, although i find political analysis much more intriguing (works well with a background and training in the discipline of history, by the way. lots of crossover). any chance you'll share where yours comes from?"

I have had run ins with many on these threads and seen them all off. It may not be possible to be entirely subjective but it is the duty of a historian or any social scientist to attempt it otherwise we may as well not bother, each man's opinion is as good as the other: the Turk, the Armenian, the Nazi or the Jew, history becomes a moral vacuum where judgement is prohibited."
100,justlittleoldme,13 May 2014 12:16pm,1,False,"well, thank you for sharing. and congratulations on seeing off those superficial and ignorant posers. and the political extremists! seeing as you've wrongly attributed those characteristics to me, though, i have to wonder why your criteria for assessment is. is it simply that they disagree with you and you know of no other way of critical engagement than name calling and dismissal? and yes, subjectivity is a problem within any discipline. but a good scholar recognises that. they recognise that there is no one absolute, and they reflect on the role of their own subjectivity in their own analysis. anyone, within the discipline of history or any other discipline, who does otherwise is denying the complexity of reality and thus diminishing the lessons we can learn from it - it is saying that one person's word is better than another, more morally superior?, and that automatically eliminates a good chunk of the 'story' (i'll put it in scare quotes, just for you). it's not necessary to eliminate subjectivity, but recognising it and its role is a must, both for the historian and for the audience."

My, we have got a thin skin haven't we? 'Cheeky bugger' is hardly that and was more a response to your demands that I provide you with a reading list, having rejecteed my suggestions as of 'no use'. If you're such an expert you should be telling me what to read."
102,justlittleoldme,13 May 2014 3:27pm,0,False,"ha! i like that you think i might be offended by being called cheeky bugger. no, my friend, that was not what i was referring to when i accused you of name calling. i believe your accusations of ignorance, superficiality, political extremism, and oh, holocaust denial, simply because someone didn't agree with your particular viewpoint, was more what i was getting at. and i think if you read a bit more carefully, you'll see that i said those were of no use to me as i'm looking for new material to read and, as i said, i have already read them. it's not saying &quot;those are bad because you suggested them and therefore i reject them!&quot; rather, it is saying &quot;hey, i've already read those, so in terms of expanding my understanding, they are of no use to me. do you have anything else that i might find useful and interesting?&quot; but then again, hostility and an attitude of &quot;i see them all off&quot; does tend to cloud one's reading. we all get there sometimes, no harm done. and finally, unlike you i have never claimed to be an expert in this particular field. i could point you in the direction of some good readings on post-conflict reconciliation within society, social and political factors that impact upon societal acceptance (forced or not forced) of violent or totalitarian regimes, and the impact of rhetoric or propaganda in the instigation or spread of violence during genocide, though. let me know if you're interested, i'll dig up something that's easily accessible."
103,Tataumlives,13 May 2014 6:28pm,1,False,"No sorry you are dissembling which indicates a dishonest and devious mind at work. i. You said you were a full time historian that would make you an 'expert' by most standings. ii. If you've read those books and claim they are of 'no use' then it appears you have a very high standard of schlarship which not even the best works seems to satisfy and which inidcates someone searching for an explanation that fits his own  a priori  assumptions on the subject and that itself shows a closed mind, something you accused me of! Also dismissing a major archival find as an unimportant or insiginificant without justification shows you have an agenda that no amount of evidence will change. If you're not yet a denier you sound very much lke an apologist and not far off denial. iii. I don't see what 'post conflict reconcliation' has to do with this? But if that's your bag then I recommend you read the book about lawyers in Germany I listed that shows the power and influence of former Nazi lawyers and judges in the German legal profession long after the war, and their lack of contrition or symapthy for the regime's victims who continued to suffer as well. This is well known and now acknowlegded in Germany: look in the post war government, civil and diplomatic service well into the 70s, the Nazi elite was as entrenched, unapologetic and privileged as they had been under Hitler - if not more so - and underlines once again how deep and committed was that generation to the regime and its ideology. No pressure, no threat of retaliation, no excuses that you and other posters existed to coerce them but that still didn't change their attitude, and informed study of Nazi society shows definitively German society stood solidly behind Hitler from beginning to end. Case closed!  Only with the emergence of a newer, younger generation of activists in the late 60s did that shift and a real examination of that period and acknowledgment of the depth of complicity and commitment of their parent's generation to Hitler begin, which goes against the apologistic explanations you have offered and which the series seems keen to revive and the reason I beleive it will not stand the test of time or scholarship and why it's rightly been panned by real 'experts' which clearly you are not!"
104,justlittleoldme,13 May 2014 7:02pm,0,False,"wow. just wow. don't know why i'm wasting my time repeating the same thing over and over again, but perhaps it is in the hope that it gets through. 1) no, i did not. if you can show me where i said that i will gladly take it back and stand corrected. but perhaps this all ties into your misunderstanding of what a historian does as well as the place of history in other disciplines? 2) again, i said you suggesting them to me was of no use, not that the books themselves were of no use. i will put it to you again, to see if it gets through that thick skull: &quot;nd i think if you read a bit more carefully, you'll see that i said those were of no use to me as i'm looking for new material to read and, as i said, i have already read them. it's not saying &quot;those are bad because you suggested them and therefore i reject them!&quot; rather, it is saying &quot;hey, i've already read those, so in terms of expanding my understanding, they are of no use to me. do you have anything else that i might find useful and interesting?&quot;&quot;  and i am not a denier nor an apologist. however, i do understand that war and politics are much more complex that one act. therefore, i refuse to reduce the entirety of the nazi ideology, the dominance of that ideology in germany for nearly 15 years, and a complex war fought on a number of fronts to simply a study of the holocaust.  3) you claimed that i claimed i was an expert in history. i never made such claims, therefore i would not feel comfortable offering the expert advice that you requested. however, i am an expert in post conflict reconstruction. hence the offer to point you in that direction if you wanted good readings. seriously, dude, you need to learn how to read and understand. i'm now slightly worried about anything you present as 'fact' or 'knowledge,' simply because you have failed to demonstrate any capability to see beyond your nose. peace out, dude."

And whose reducing it to the Holocaust we’re talkinga about the complicity of that generation in Hitler’s crimes of which the Holocaust was the largest but not the only one.    seriously, dude, you need to learn how to read and understand.   Well, maybe your writing 'style' is the problem I have understanding what you’re saying, a stream of uncoordinated, rambling and barely coherent statements that indicate a modern trendy education i.e. without structure and rules or regard to your reader, and one reason you seem attracted to the ultra subjectivist, relativist approach to history where there no objective account is possible, just everyone’s own individual experience, which is all ‘equally valid’ and precludes us making any assessment or judgments about their actions and decisions.  You said your speciality is post-conflict resolution and yet you fail to challenge what is arguably the strongest evidence of the deep and profound commitment of that generation to Hitler’s regime and its ideology, to the extent that post-war German society was dominated in most important professions and in the highest levels of government by the same people for decades after the war, and who deliberatley excluded former opponents of the regime and showed a singular lack of contrition or guilt for their actions or willingness to make amends for their conduct. Surely that warrants your attention for someone with that speciality but about which you remain peculiarly silent and most likely completely indifferent towards, because it completes flattens the apologist theory you advocate.  It proves clealry that this generation was in no way coerced to follow Hitler and his pans for genocidal conquest and colonization, they were his willing ideological, political, military and social executioners and remained committed to his vision long after he and his regime had collapsed. Just face it, dude."
106,Qube2,16 May 2014 9:30am,0,False,"I think that you make too many sweeping generalisations. The regime certainly wasn't supported by everyone and Hitler probably couldn't believe his luck when he came to power, when nearly all subsequent historical commentary suggest that his political influence was on the wane when he was invited to form a government. However, he ruthlessly removed all opposition (read communists and social democrats, as well as any others who could be classified as 'endangering national security') within a few months of taking power. Ideological opponents had already been identified and were incarcerated, surveilled or curtailed in their activities. Close to where I live (in Germany) there is a concentration camp (KZ) where 600 political prisoners where held from 1933-35, including Kurt Schumacher a prominent SPD (Social Democrat) post-war leader - he was later transferred to Dachau. These camps were 2 of hundreds that sprung up to control Germans within months of Hitler taking power. This policy coupled with special (kangaroo) courts (Sondergerichte) flamed fear, suspicions and effectively curtailed much anti-nazi activity. Over 3.5 million Germans spent time in KZs, over 70,000 were executed for one form of resistance or other.There are often comments about how the German people went along with the nazis, but it is very difficult to resist when your life or your family's is threatened by your actions. Meanwhile for a sizeable number of the population, Hitler provided jobs and put bread on the table of the poorest families. It is difficult for us to know, with our relative affluence today, that not so long ago bread and a job were enough to secure someone's trust and support. Why would they question if most things (even the start of Hitler's war from 1939-40) appeared to support the Nazis' assertions of German supremacy -I don't recall uprisings or resistance by loyal Brits about the wrongs of colonialism while the going was good. As for the more intelligent, I suspect they knew to keep their heads down. Are the Iraqi people any less for not having resisted Saddam or Camodians Pol Pot? No. They too faced a situation where their resistance would only mean their death. Generation War is a fiction and there are some inconsistencies, but as a representation of the descent of men to madness and murder it works. I fail to see how anyone is trying to get off the hook here. The scene of the SS officer shooting the jewish girl is damning of the type of appalling violence that Germans were involved in. Or the wider story of Viktor Goldstein (the Jewish friend) facing anti-semitism from others than Nazis is representative of some european attitudes then and sadly still know. Still stronger is the descent of Friedhelm from educated man of letters to compromised and slavish obedience -primarily as a way of surviving. The representation of Wilhelm as an army soldier rather than a nazi is also reasonable as the army saw itself as an honourable and disciplined unit at least to start with in the war. I fail to see what is wrong with describing any or all of these people as victims. We are all victims of our choices as well as the behaviour of others. All sullied by our experiences. In Germany, this series was important as it prompted grandchildren and children to ask their parents, what did you do in the war? Perhaps a last chance to question a generation again. It seems very easy for us to stand at a distance and make judgements, without much idea of what it was like. However, what is clear, not only from this three part series but from our knowledge of conflict, is that once people feel threatened or see their neighbours bombed or killed, the sense and urgency of survival kicks in. In this state, people unite and fight, not for any great reasons or support for an ideology, just to survive.FYI, my family is English, Irish, Polish and Jewish. I don't hold much to such ethnic descriptions (put it this way, it doesn't define me). I only offer that information so that I'm not categorised as an apologist for German culpability, which I am most definitely not."
107,Tataumlives,16 May 2014 9:56am,1,False,"The scene of the SS officer shooting the jewish girl is damning of the type of appalling violence that Germans were involved in.   But that's the point an SS man shooting a Jew is not exactly a shock is it? The question was the attitude of ordinary Germans in this case the oridinary soldiers and the evidence in contrast to the sanitised version presented here, is that most German soldiers took part in atrocities willingly, even enthusiastically it's documented in the book Soldaten I quoted earlier in thousands of hours of candid transcripts, which one of your co-apologists tried to dismiss in true revisionist style. But for me as I've already argued the most powerful argument for the guilt and complicity of most ordinary Germans in Nazi crimes was the entrenched and unapologetic attitudes and views of the post-war generation free of Hitler and any threat of retaliation from his security apparatus, expressed in many surveys, anecdotes and other evidence, who with a few reservations declared their continued support and approval for Hitler's regime and what he had attempted, the only regret being that he failed. This, a generation that shaped post war Germany and dominated its civil, diplomatic, legal and other professions which overflowed with former Nazis, a situation that only began to change in the '70s as their children began to push them out and demanded a reckoning with Germany's dark past. This film is not a whitewash but it swings back too far the other way, presenting a sanitised and unrealisic picture of the attitudes and behaviour of most ordinary Germans a form of mild, but still very questionable revisionism."

And the 70,000 figure were mostly during the war, when the Nazis lowered the threshold of capital crimes to include almost anything, read the book I referenced Furchtbare Juristen about the complicity of the legal and justice system in Nazi crimes. Of course the Nazis painted them as resistance and traitors, but most were executed for petty crimes such as stealing to feed their families, but which the Nazis criminalised as Landesverrat. Anyone who commited the smallest crime even minor expressions of defeatism or grumbling were automatically branded traitors, and all too often betrayed by friends and relatives were only too ready to shop them to the Gestapo.

It was a very subtle, very cleverly, constructed piece of historical license with a highly questionable political message, that Germans were no more, and possibly even much less guilty than others. Arguably a more insidious and dangerous form of revisionism than out-and-out denial. The charge of apologism stands!"

You with many others on this thread betray a dangerously naive underestimation of the power of mass media and entertainment to shape and distort people's view of history and reality, a naivete the Nazis did not share; they understood and exploited it all too well with disastrous consequences, as apparently do the makers of this series.

I find it totally implausible that someone with relatives who died in camps could talk with such naive stupidity, or is this some kind or revolt against your heritage?

Your parallel with the British empire is also spurious, obnoxious and a malicious slander, since firstly there was never a campaign of systematic liquidation and genocide against pacified populations, and secondly during the Boer War and similar incidents, there were many large, open and bitter public demonsrations, and open criticism of the war and its conduct both in the press and in the commons among leading politicians that came close to bringing down the government, so you are clearly very ill informed, ignorant and completely out of your depth!  Interesetingly your arguments that Hitler put 'bread on the table' and 'gave people work' were also those offered inside and outside Germany, by sympathisers and apologists of the time, arguments that could be found among influential appeasers and (anti semitic) Nazi sympathisers in the British elites and corridors of power in the 30s, saying we should 'find an accomodation' with Hitler and sacrifice the Jews as a matter of course. I'm sure your relatives will understand and appreciate you finding much to agree and common cause with those who turned a blind eye and privately approved of their destruction at the time.

The most poetic and sensitive of the five was even ready to be mown down by Russian bullets, I suspect, not because he had become fully brain-washed, but because he realised what he had become.

The German histoiran Sönke Nietzel has put together accounts from 1000s of hours of transcripts of conversations ordinary German soldiers boasting about their participation in massacres and organised shootings of Jews and others, that makes it clear these were anything but 'unwilling executioners'. This film attempts to portray Germans being placed in an impossible position and that they were in their own way 'victims', while the real nasties were anti-semitic Ukrainian collaborators, Polish partisans and the Red Army.

There were scenes of butchery, executions, anti-semitism from differing sides - all quite accurate of what we know occurred. You should stop viewing this as a decisive and summative account of what really happened. It is a flavour of the horror and descent of men. It shows nice people, people with values and then how they are broken. It shows murderers and ignorants lashing out with illogic, fear and brutality and eventually getting precisely what they deserve. It shows the innocent (the old polish couple in their farm or the Jewish girl executed) being herded and terrorised with the cheapness of their lives. Friedhelm looks like a pretty willing executioner to me."

You couldn't possibly revere Hitler - be willing to die for the Fuhrer - on the one hand, whilst on the other hand thinking to yourself 'he's going a bit ape about the poor old Jews. They're surely not that bad'.   So incredibly simplistic I don't even know where to start. First of all, what do you even mean by &quot;being a Nazi&quot;? You have to distinguish between those who were genuine ideological Nazis (the party elite and the early adapters but yes, also many ordinary citizens), those who were &quot;opportunistic&quot; Nazis (it was a good career move) and those who were &quot;paper&quot; Nazis, who had little choice in the matter.  Only the first group actually &quot;revered&quot; Hitler; the other couple included people with a very broad cross-section of opinions and, indeed, people with no opinion much whatsoever. (E.g., to cite one extreme, Oskar Schindler was a very successful &quot;opportunisic&quot; Nazi to the end!) Secondly, it's patently untrue that every (or even most soldiers) were &quot;willing to die for the Führer&quot;. Or even supported the goals of the Nazis. (You have to distinguish between the SS and the Wehrmacht.) Again, every man had his own story, but the truth on the ground was far more complicated than you describe. Many saw it as being willing to die for their country, as opposed to its regime, and many others simply saw it in terms of taking their oath of loyalty to their &quot;brother soldiers&quot; seriously. Indeed, the latter is the line taken by e.g. a number of active members of the White Rose resistance group, who were serving soldiers all the while they were also actively working to spark a popular revolt against Hitler! (I suggest you read or watch one of the numerous interviews with Fritz Hartnagel, the fiance of Sophie Scholl and later husband of one of her sisters, who survived Stalingrad, was judged a &quot;Mitläufer&quot;* by the de-nazification courts and who spent the rest of his life campaiging against war and fascism. He explained his thinking on this subject at the time very well - but I suspect the messy reality may exceed your black and white world view.)  The other point you seem to entirely miss is that your average German soldier - in common with your average soldier at every time and place in history - was far more interested in staying alive than in dying for anything! Given that the draft was universal, being a conscientious objector was not an option and the penalty for desertion/refusing your call-up was death if you were caught, &quot;being willing to die&quot; was your only real option one way or the other! Doing it &quot;for Hitler&quot; gave you a better chance at survival than &quot;against Hitler&quot;. Frankly, I hope that had I been alive then, I would have had the courage of my convictions the way Sophie Scholl did of hers - but I'm honest enough to say, I'm not at all sure I would have. Would you have definitely refused military service/deserted and happily gone to the your execution instead? If you are willing to unequivocally say yes, then, with all due respect, I think you are lying, or you haven't actually thought about it deeply at all! *There is no real English equivalent to the German term Mitläufer , which I find a shame, as they exist at all times and in all places as well. Literally &quot;someone who goes along with something&quot;, referring to people take part in a movement, ideology and/or action in a minor role, and without genuinely believing in it - in contrast to genuine sympathisers or &quot;fellow travellers&quot;... A large number if not the majority were Mitläufer, as opposed to Hitler-worshippers, and I think you greatly underestimate the degree of &quot;indifference&quot; that was indeed present..."

145,SocalAlex,12 May 2014 7:49pm,5,False,"I'm half Austrian. Perhaps, in your opinion, that makes me &quot;biased&quot;? My late Austrian grandma being an example. Born in 1912, into incredibly poor circumstances, she had no choice but to leave school to work in a shop at age 14. She was intelligent and intellectually curious, but her passions were art and music and literature, and till her dying day, two years ago, she remained a-political and completely disinterested in history and current affairs to a degree I (a political scientist &quot;by trade&quot; and self-described &quot;news whore&quot; and activist for as long as I can remember) found nearly impossible to even conceive!  She was also ambitious, teaching herself stenography and to speak more nicely in her free time and working her way up to a secretarial job in the local government and a lower middle-class lifestyle. One she -painfully class-conscious and appearance-conscious to her dying day as well - already then worried was &quot;too good for&quot; her. And so, knowing nothing of politics and current events and caring even less, her middle-class, well-educated superiors and colleagues told her the Nazis were a &quot;good thing&quot; she assumed they, being so much more clever and worldly were probably right, without bothering to look into it much in detail. (Did she vote for the Anschluss ? To be honest, I never - dared? - ask her; she probably either did or didn't vote at all, and if she did, it wasn't for ideological reasons, but because she was pretty much indifferent (she'd been born into a country which no longer existed, she'd already experienced three vastly different forms of government - the Austro-Hungarian empire, the first Austrian republic, and the short-lived home-grown fascist state - and the intervening chaos of the transitions, without being consciously personally affected by any of it) yet her &quot;betters&quot; (in her and society's opinion/in actual fact quite the opposite) told her to do so, and, in her words, &quot;they must be right&quot;. And then, because she worked for her local government, which overnight went from being &quot;Austrian&quot; to &quot;German&quot;, she had to join the Nazi party on paper to keep her job. At the beginning, she also saw the &quot;benefits&quot; of the Nazis - after all, they &quot;gave&quot; her her first paid vacation in over a decade and a half of full-time work -, and her naivite and genuine a-political indifference and the natural human tendency towards denial and repression kept her insulated from their full horror until it was too late.  Was she &quot;anti-semitic&quot;? Certainly no more and indeed far less so than many other people of similar backgrounds in the U.K. and the U.S. at the time. Was she &quot;evil&quot;? Certainly not! Her &quot;crimes&quot; were of omission rather than commission. The man who later became my grandfather also worked for the local government, but in a far more senior function. He refused to join the Nazi Party, and was promptly fired Already too old to be drafted he was unemployed for the duration of the war.  My grandmother's brother was a life-long Socialist. But he was equally poor and poorly-educated, and unlike her, was not ambitious. He was not &quot;leader&quot; material, he was no hero - which makes him no different from the vast majority of us. He remained a political activist, he continued to speak out openly against the Nazis as long as it was still &quot;safe enough&quot; to do so, and once it no longer was, he did so privately. And when he was drafted, he joined up and fought because - as &quot;wrong&quot; as you may find it - he wanted to live. As it happened, he didn't, dying a couple of weeks before the end of war; it took my grandmother/great-grandmother a few years to even find out that much and where. And it was only via Google and the paltry Red Cross documents they received that I could make an educated guess at the &quot;how&quot; a couple years ago - from injuries sustained by an America/British bombing raid, 3 days after the fact... So, was my grandmother &quot;a Nazi&quot;? Not according to the Americans who occupied her city - they didn't even judge her a candidate for minimal &quot;denazification&quot;, but seemlessly continued to employ her!  Was her brother? Did he deserve to die? Are the children/grandchildren of those who killed him justified in gloating about it? Was my grandfather &quot;evil/cowardly&quot; for merely sacrificing his livelihood rather than his life? It's easy to self-righteously denounce all Germans as &quot;evil&quot; from your comfortable 2014 armchair. Honestly putting yourselves in their shoes isn't.  And it hasn't escaped my notice that the very people who tend to bang on loudest about the Nazis are the very ones most eager to defend the flagrant disregard for the rule of law and the illegal wars our own current Western governments are engaged in!"

148,yealandRed,12 May 2014 2:05pm,6,False,"Antisemitism was pervasive throughout Europe at this time and certainly was a problem in Poland, particularly as it had a large Jewish population. So I had no problem seeing Polish antisemitism - of the partisan group and of the local farmers too. But what was a bit rich was that, because of the way in which the programme was structured, they really seemed to be the most anti-Semitic of the lot (although we did have Ukrainians rounding up jews in an earlier episode). I think it got a bit stupid how anti jewish ideology was somehow seen as more important than the general fight against the Nazis. Basically they wanted Viktor to always be under threat so his scenes seemed to be a constant case of antisemitism one-upmanship. The programme did try to show how people can become indoctrinated by ideology particularly in the actions of the nurse Charly who was ready to report her assistant as Jewish with no thought for the consequences despite having a Jewish friend herself. It a horrendous and pathetic decision and somehow believable as people can be very inconsistent in their actions."
149,daisydill,12 May 2014 2:48pm,1,False,"Re the programme being structured to make Poland the villain - while I haven't seen it (and don't intend to) - I did expect that it would tend that way, as in the Official Version of WW2 the Axis Powers often seem to be Poland, Poland and Poland nowadays. The world of politics and political correctness is a strange and twisted one. Usually resisting the Nazis is considered to be A Very Good Thing Indeed - except if you are Polish, and then it becomes Very Bad. Once again, the lesson I take from this is to stay neutral. Poland has of course to take its share of the blame for the crimes of the Allied Powers. Those crimes have no political weight though."

And I wouldn't have wanted the programme banned or anything. The German viewpoint needs to be heard. They had a terrible time too.  Perhaps we will see more nuanced portrayals of French and Dutch resistance to the Nazis, if we must go on making programmes about WW2?  Though I had much rather that we - the children of Adam - had born in mind that our Creator, the God of Abraham, has told us the love &quot;does not keep account of the injury&quot;. Wouldn't we all be getting along so much better if we had? And its not as if we have learnt any lessons from this constant memorialising of WW2.

Of course there were strained plot-lines, impossibilities and incomprehensible coincidences, but it is fiction, what do we expect?It was well acted, filmed and directed in my opinion and more than anything, it was a German programme.

162,crisscross,12 May 2014 2:06pm,7,False,"I did enjoy Generation War - it was very good drama. However, it was terribly flawed in some respects.  1. The plot device of numerous, highly unlikely coincidences (though I appreciate this was done in the interests of the drama).2. The notion that in 1941 the five central characters would not have realised Hitler's agenda in respect of the Jews, and other ethnic groups and minorities. Indeed, there is no open discussion of Hitler's &quot;final solution&quot; in any of the three episodes. What about the Hitler Youth? What about Goebbels' Jew-baiting propaganda? Kristallnacht? Mein Kampf?3. The incredible notion that in 1941, Greta would have gone out openly in Berlin with her Jewish boyfriend, Victor (who made no attempt to hide his Jewishness).4. The idea that Greta would be a supporter of Hitler in 1941, as she was clearly portrayed to be, despite having a Jewish boyfriend, and that she would then go to the opposite extreme and get a Gestapo lover. She clearly knew Victor was in danger, as she attempted to persuade the Gestapo guy to get Victor papers to enable him to escape to New York.5. The demonisation of the Polish partisans as anti-semites prepared to kill Jews, in contrast with the sympathetic portrayal of the central characters, none of whom express anti-semitic sentiments. I understand that contemporary Germans might find it hard to accept that their own parents and grandparents committed mind-boggling war crimes, and would like a more sympathetic portrayal of innocent young people caught up in something they did not understand, and later could not get out of.

This is the wrong way round - and there's no need to be insulted on anybody's behalf.  It's only understandable if you take it in the context of the decades on careful work done in Germany to acknowledge crimes - much more so than has ever been done in Britain concerning the empire, for example. Apart from a few nutters, people do acknowledge the crimes that were committed. But the issue of who to identify with is the important one here, and that's what the drama addressed: it made things difficult for the audience, and I admired that. Yes, the coincidences were astounding, but it is a drama, after all. I thought Greta was an interesting portrayal of somebody swinging between extremes in an impossible situation, torn between loyalty and opportunism."
164,Ruelan,12 May 2014 9:58pm,5,False,"Indeed, there is no open discussion of Hitler's &quot;final solution&quot; in any of the three episodes.   Probably because the average German didnt take part in the Wannensee conference.    What about the Hitler Youth?   I think you got other stuff on your mind when you are being sent to the Eastern Front. But yeah no Hitler Youth. But then again the BDM was present.    What about Goebbels' Jew-baiting propaganda?   Because all Germans listened to it. Its basically present in the SS.    Kristallnacht?   You can not really expect German writers to include it if they have never seen a Jew in their entire life.    Mein Kampf?   The book that no one ever read.    4.

Yeah lets ignore the leader of the Polish fighters who wasnt anti-semitic and lets concentrate on those two who were.Also lets forget the point-blank headshot of the Jewish girl by the SS officer or the train full of Jews bound for a camp. Or all the other &quot;fun stuff&quot; the Germans did. Like clearing the minefield. Thats what the good guys do. Its obvious that the Poles were the evil ones!    I understand that contemporary Germans might find it hard to accept that their own parents and grandparents committed mind-boggling war crimes   &quot;All Germans back then committed war crimes and if you dont portray every single one of them doing those in the media its wrong!&quot; So which particular war crimes did my Grandfathers and their brothers commit exactly.

He is part of the Wehrmacht and the TV series shows quite clearly that war crimes were not restricted to the Nazi paramilitary forces attached to the army, the SS, and that Wehrmacht officers and soldiers were indeed complicit. This was not accepted for a long time in post-war Germany - at least till the 1970s. It may be a small point but the writer of this blog assumes that the surviving friends just happen to stumble upon each other in the bar at the end which would be a rather ridiculous co-incidence. Screen writers and dramatists do h use shorthand without 'filler scenes' so it seemed clear to me that the friends had already been able to connect after the war and had arranged to meet at the bar. We just weren't showed old-fashioned Hollywood style montages of the survivors writing to each other to set up the meeting. The producers assume the audience can fill in the gaps."

173,thegirlfrommarz,12 May 2014 2:33pm,10,False,"I thought Generation War was mostly excellent - a flawlessly acted, gripping, emotionally involving drama about a side of the war that felt new to me as a Brit (of German extraction - my grandparents left Berlin for London in the 1930s, partly for economic reasons but partly due to my grandfather's Jewish ancestry). Watching it was rather like reading All Quiet on the Western Front for the first time - a story you know very well but from a different viewpoint. The final episode didn't quite match up to the first two, with coincidences that felt contrived for dramatic necessity and therefore a bit clunky (Lilja, Victor/Friedhelm's meeting, the final three meeting back in the bar where it all began), but it was absorbing and moving. I do agree with a lot of the criticisms - for example, barely anyone appeared to be an enthusiastic Nazi, except for the members of the Gestapo or SS. I thought it let ordinary Germans off too easily - but then again, it quickly moved the action away from Berlin to the Eastern Front and barely came back until the end. Even so, the fact that the group of close friends who had grown up under the Third Reich included a Jewish man was raised in the discussion programme as unlikely, and did feel like a dramatic contrivance at best to include the Jewish experience in its &quot;five friends&quot; conceit (but even then Generation War avoided showing the concentration camps). The &quot;war is hell&quot; message was very clear, but perhaps more emphasis could have been put on what was particularly terrible about this war and Germany's part in it, especially the visceral racial hatred that was only really hinted at by the woman who moved into Victor's parents' house and the SS officer who shot a little girl. I didn't think that the programme was trying to suggest that all partisans were anti-semitic, but if I were Polish I might well have felt indignant about that, and that point was well covered in the discussion programme afterwards. The cast was generally excellent, but I would pick out Friedhelm in particular, whose transformation from sensitive naif to nihilistic killer was incredibly well acted. Friedhelm was so damaged and had done such terrible things that there was no way back for him, and his &quot;suicide by Russians&quot; made emotional sense. By contrast, Greta had a rather underwritten final episode - all the big drama for her happened in episode 2, and the prison scenes didn't seem to add much. Was it perfect? No. Was it historically accurate? Probably not. But it was a gripping and absorbing TV drama, and the conversations it has sparked are interesting and important ones. If I have one complaint, it was that it shied away from the the most difficult issues - we never saw the concentration camps, we weren't really shown what it was that turned Nazi Germany into a byword for evil. Maybe that wasn't the story it set out to tell - but it could have done more there."
174,BlutoBlutarsky,13 May 2014 12:01pm,4,False,"A very good comment - in fact, an excellent mini-review; better than some others I've read. The link in the article above to the German review is revealing. The point the reviewer makes is that these were not typical young people of the time. Even ZDF producer Benedict did not make the claim that the five young friends were typical, but only that such friendships (Germans and Jews in 1941) were just possible. The problem with this portrayal of everyone's 'mothers or fathers' was that exceptional people were shown to be representative of the young Germans of the day when they clearly were not.. By contrast, we had the Polish partisans as types, not exceptions, and these types were almost exclusively anti-Semitic. ZDF has therefore taken the best Germans and presented them as typical and taken the worst Poles and presented those as typical. Fair? I don't think so. The scene with the freight cars and the AK (not sure if a spoiler alert is really necessry at this point, since this has been available on clips for many months) raises the following question: Viktor says: &quot;A co z nimi?&quot; (What about them?) &quot;Are they supposed to die like that?&quot; The partisan replies: &quot;Most of them are Jews. And Jews are as bad as communists or Russkies. Better dead than alive.&quot; So - the partisan is acknowledging that there may be some non-Jews on board. But since he hates Jews so much, he is willing to sacrifice even those individuals.  No wonder the Polish ambassador called this scene &quot;absurd&quot;.Others have been far less charitable."

(And, yes, most Germans do have a great sense of humour, contrary to myth).

183,Qube2,16 May 2014 9:59am,0,False,"Of course, the 1968 student protests were an urge to out and rid the system of nazis, like the character Dorn (Greta's Gestapo man), who had simply slipped back in to a suit and a desk job in the post war system. Germans don't forget this past, which is a good thing. However, they don't need to beat themselves up about it either. And they are allowed to recognise how they suffered through their country's actions as willing and unwilling participants."
184,InFlanders,12 May 2014 3:03pm,2,False,"I thought the coincidences of the friends meeting now and again spoiled the drama. Not because the chance meetings were not believable - even though they weren't - but because they were actually less dramatically powerful than if the friends had never met again (at least till after the war), or were shown to have almost been able to meet (for example one passes within a few miles of the other).  The tragedy of war is that often people don't meet again. Last letters are sometimes delivered, but more often lost. Someone promises to carry a letter for another person, but then the letter carrier him/herself gets killed. Last farewells never reach the recipient. To me that is much more poignant in dramatic terms than dramatically- orchestrated 'meet ups'."

But the bigos scene shows up the contrast between the way the Germans and the Poles are depicted. Friedhelm might go on to become a deranged murderer, but he starts out as a sensitive, Hermann Hesse-reading intellectual, whereas the bigos-eating Poles are inherently nasty, even if one of them turns out slightly less nasty than the others."

Reich and WWII, only slowly starting to confront itself with the past in the late 80s, ironically triggered by Waldheim's stubborn denial and Haider's impertinence. Instead, let me add a meta-observation: the above comments indicate a remarkably sober and fair-minded appreciation of controversy which might not be generally prevalent but at least proves what a level-headed discussion can achieve in thought-provoking and enlightening terms."

I believe the initial part of the story to be something approaching a Friends do Berlin approach but it seemed to me that after the initial part the programme attempted to be more historically correct. I enjoyed what i saw for TV watching but unlike a film i once witnessed about the White Rose in Munich University or from reading the book Alone in Berlin i could not feel the claustrophobic terror initiated by the Nazi regime and learnt nothing new in how regimes retain power when all around know ddep down somethings wrong.

I made a complaint about this to the BBC and they replied in an email, writing:- 'It is clearly not possible for a 3 part fictional drama toportray a complete picture of World War II and nor will that be the expectation of the audience.' How snotty and disingenuous can you get! Indeed, on the BBC discussion programme of the series, all the academics were so furious with the spineless male producer of the series, that it looked like he was going to flee the studio at one point. Maybe the BBC should have replied to me, by writing;- &quot; We're so sorry that we allowed a suspect wartime drama to air on the BBC, especially one that attempted to re-write recent European history in such an underhand and annoying way. As we currently have a monopoly on the dissemination of high culture in the UK, your opinion counts for nothing and it will end up where all the opinions of people we don't like belong, - in the dustbin of history! My daddy told me to say that. In addition, we are making a fortune from the sale of our TV programmes to Germany and if we had refused to purchase and screen Generation War our German friends would have been very upset. We are working in a very competitive, global TV industry and we purchased the series at a very good rate.  Furthermore, the series stirred up much controversy. We knew it would. Stirring up controversy creates an amoral vacuum where we can have our cake and eat it. We get loads of attention, and money ! and if things get tough, we just put on a discussion programme at the end of the series to show we are fair and objective. Genius!  Ultimately, all of us here at the BBC are Oxbridge educated so we know what the real sub-text of the series is. We realize the series depicted the Poles and Ukrainians as bigger anti-semites than the Germans. We also know that the German friends had a Jew in their midst whom they loved as much as themselves.  Thus, 'Generation War' was essentially an apology for the holocaust from a country sick to death of this 'holocaust industry' that we are all having to read about the whole time. Holocaust this, holocaust that. Oy vey!We can't stand it anymore. It reminds us of our own anti-semitic attitudes here in the UK. Come on, let's all be friends. Stop complaining and let us all 'move on.' And lastly, while we are at it, I still have £130,000 to pay on my mortgage for my flat in Notting Hill.

Were none of these questions asked of their father when they made their farewells ? That is the unrealistic part at the very beginning. It is one thing to suggest that they were corrupted by the what they saw happening to civilians in RussIa , but the corruption had already been happening and the film in my view was flawed form the very beginning That said it would be simplistic to suggest the five young people were all guilty to an equal extent as members the Nazi Party, but neither would they have been as innocent of what what had been happening in Germany before the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 as the film seems to suggest. The two really fascinating questions to me is how a country , the land of Bach, Beethoven and Goethe succumbed to such evil which Hitler and the Nazi party created and could it have happened here if say Winston Churchill had been forced out of office in June 1940 following the fall of France-probably not for which we might thank Henry VIII who whatever his other faults ensured that antisemitism did not take root in this country as it did in Germany"

There was still fighting going on in the East as the Russian civil war continued and Russia and Poland fought a war. Also there was unrest, fighting and movement of peoples in parts of what had been Austria Hungary. In fact Austria-Hungary was the most dismembered party to the war and some of the countries such as Hungary felt just as diminished as Germany. The big difference is that Germany was still a very significant country in European politics and felt that its problems deserved addressing more than any other and what's more eventually had to means to do so hence the war."

I don't expect perfection or total accuracy, mostly because I understand that there is no such thing as &quot;the truth&quot; when it comes to retelling history. There will be different interpretations based on different experiences, different perspectives, different understandings, etc. But in comparison with other WWII dramas, where the same themes and issues are brought out again and again and again, Generation War was interesting in that it brought up new things and it challenged my own biases and preconceptions. It's an interesting starting point for a topic that isn't discussed enough, and for me, that alone makes it worthwhile."

Her mundanely terrifying execution upset me the most. Charly had sugar coated altruism but scatch underneath that thin sugar there lurked a cold hearted nazi. e.g the scene when she chillingly dismissed the local women assembled for a job. And the Russian Front seemed a very small place where folks kept bumping into each other all the time! I realize that was required to move the drama forward but still a bit clunky. The UK &amp; USA turned a blind eye to any former nazi they could re-use to build a stable new Germany or nuclear weapon! Overall a gripping tale and so long as accept it was not a documentary like The World AT War Series it did provide an insight into Germans history previously over looked. The all pervasive social claustrophobia of nazi Germany could have been teased out more but on the whole I am glad Wilhelm not Freidheim survived."

I think some of the critics, expecting 20-21 years old Germans in 1941 to be politically aware, and wondering why they aren't anti-regime, is naive. Most young people &quot;don't do politics&quot;, and doubly so if you'd been brainwashed while growing up in the Hitler Youth.

The hospital scenes were gripping, bloody and totally realistic as was the depiction of the hell that was the Eastern Front. In many ways it echoed Joseph Vilsmaier's movie 'Stalingrad'. Sadly the series was badly promoted and badly scheduled and as a result probably only attracted a small audience."
218,HermanTheHun,12 May 2014 8:46pm,6,False,"Watching this discussion I can't help the feeling that all of those kind contributors of this discussion - me included - , all of us children of democracy and its sure feeling of that inalienable right of free expression (except of course to your boss - you don't want to get fired), I can't help the feeling that we all don't know how it is to live in a dictatorship ,who clearly shows its ruthlessness in snatching people from the streets, in spreading fear by those rumors about concentration camps (the first prisoners of these camps were German communists and social democrats, not Jews), in forcing you to a military training in which you had hardly any rights whatsoever. I have asked myself the question many how I would have reacted in these times, and I simply don't know. And I have to smile whenever somebody comes up with a clear and noble answer. Maybe the Germans are just fed up with the average English, American, Dutch, French, whatever moral Herrenmensch, who wants to rub his inherited moral superiority in this miserable Jerry to show him his place. Believe me, I know what I am talking about. So they made a movie in which one possible aspect of the life in this time is shown, while knowing that it can't be complete.As for those who want to have a full, accurate and complete picture of this time, why don't you watch these superb British movies with noble and gallant British officers, politicians and people and these nasty, cruel and cold German Nazi officers.

But, as I have said above, isn't the truth about WW2 that both sides did terrible ungodly things? I don't see that either side has the high moral ground here. There was Stalin on one side, and Hitler on the other. Both killed millions. Hadn't Stalin killed millions of Ukrainians before WW2 even began, so he kind of had a head start. I haven't seen the programme, but am glad that Germans can tell their story. I don't usually watch or read anything about WW2, but I did watch Das Boot many years ago, and thought it very powerful. The claustrophobic nature of that submarine - and those brave and terrified young men... It was heartbreaking really.  All I am objecting to is Poland being made responsible for Axis crimes. We have of course to take our share of responsibility for Allied war crimes.  And, no, those of us who have not been put in the situation Germans were at that time should not be judging. Though I would like to say something about the German Christian congregation, the Earnest Bible Students, or Jehovah's Witnesses, who refused even to &quot;Heil&quot; Hitler, let alone join his Nazi party or his army, and they suffered terribly for it. They stood firm throughout the Hitler years, and even though many were killed, they survived as a congregation."

I think the Western allies at least have some claim to moral superiority - no Katyn massacres there. And then they rather nicely paid for Western Germany to be put back on its feet.    We have of course to take our share of responsibility for Allied war crimes.   Like what? The Poles in the Red Army probably had their part in the destruction and rape of much of Germany but to be frank it's difficult to put yourself in their shoes. Poland lost 20% of its population in five years. That's a hell of a lot of vengeance. We all smile at the Pole sin 'Battle of Britain' disobeying orders and tearing into the Germans, but it's worth remembering what they had already been through and why they played by different rules to the British. Remember the Dutch surrendered because the Germans bluntly reminded them that Dutch cities were made of wood and they couldn't stop the Germans firestorming each and every one of them."

It was obviously a war crime and I don't justify it. But given what the soldiers of the Red Army had seen, I can understand it. Certainly it's much more understandable than what the Wehrmacht did to Poland and the Soviet Union - the Red Army at least had the excuse of revenge."
225,Bangorstu,14 May 2014 12:21pm,1,False,"The mass bombing of German cities was certainly justified - the factories were producing weapons and it makes a horrific sense to target the workers as well. And, note, the Germans were the first to use that tactic so the line had been crossed.  Dresden is a controversial case. Certainly an argument can be made for bombing it - it was a communications hub and had over a hundred factories. Our purpose was, after all, to help the red Army and save Soviet lives rather than German ones. Whether the bombing was proportionate is another thing. Technically incidentally not a war crime as aerial bombing wasn't covered by the Hague Conventions of the time."
226,daisydill,14 May 2014 1:56pm,0,False,"OK, Bangorstu, clearly the fire bombing of Dresden was not a war crime in the legal sense - though a horrible thing in itself - but the mass rape surely was. I don't know if any Polish soldiers were involved in it! I very much hope not - but they could have been. I thought it was carried out, as a matter of policy, by the Red Army I just wanted to make the point that I couldn't object to Poland taking its share of the blame for Allied crimes, but it is not responsible for the crimes of the Axis Powers. War is an awful business. Which is why they should never get started in the first place."
227,Bangorstu,14 May 2014 6:31pm,0,False,"Mass rape is definitely a war crime. There does seem to be something in the male psyche which, after being exposed to extreme combat, makes them prone to that kind of behaviour as a kind of catharsis. Witness the British sack of Badajoz in Spain in 1812 for an example. Or indeed the behaviour of the Red Army or for that matter soldiers just about everywhere. That's not to excuse it - firm discipline and control by officers is required, but to explain why it seems to happen. IIRC the Red Army in taking Berlin were told that the women were there for the taking (in anticipation of extreme casualties) which elevates the crime somewhat. As you say, it's different if made policy. Were Poles involved? I expect so - there were plenty fighting alongside the Russians and I doubt they behaved any better."
228,brambalus,14 May 2014 8:45pm,1,False,"Dresden was horrific. I first read about the bombing in Kurt Vonnegut's 'Slaugherhouse 5', but since then am shocked at the devastation that was wreaked on a civilian population.

At any rate, had I seen this programme - which I have not and don't intend to - it seems it would have reinforced the wisdom of the advice in the Inspired Scriptures.

230,SolarTime2012,15 May 2014 11:54am,0,False,The ONLY reason that the mass bombing of cities was not a legal war crime while obviously being a war crime is because in the 1930's there was a conference of lawyers to make bombing of civilians and cities a war crime.

In his moment of triumph he told one reporter half on and off the record.... &quot;We insisted on reserving the right to bomb the niggers !&quot; No wonder Hitler took inspiration from the example of the British Empire.

235,BlughGrant,12 May 2014 10:21pm,3,False,"I thought it was a moving and very well made portrayal of the German part of that generation lost to madness and war. I don't think it showed the characters as being in any way unaware or naive of what was going on around them - they were all well aware right at the start of what danger there was for Viktor - or of all being conveniently anti-Nazi, indeed some of them were shown to be very much subscribed to believing in the war and victory. And yet while at the same time sure, they had a Jewish friend, and sure they were naive in their attitudes towards the war and what it would involve, to say that those paradoxes are unrealistic is wrong. Those paradoxes are what make them ultimately human characters, in denial of the truths they want to conveniently ignore so they can try and carry on living their normal lives. Any drama that attempts to take on such a subject matter and allow it's characters to be actual human beings that we can't simply see as villains is making a big target of itself, but it's important that these things are tried because the reality isn't so conveniently black and white as &quot;all germans were bad guys&quot;."

If only these people would examine and question US/UK propaganda movies with the same attention to detail as they do with this comparatively accurate German movie they would probably end up with a much more realistic view on what actually happened back in that horrible war.
237,RougeTrooper,13 May 2014 2:25am,2,False,"Which UK/US movies do you think were less realistic, @Lintflas? Are you asking we judge this German TV mini-series about five fictional Germans against them, rather on its own claims and/or merits?"

240,Eesy,13 May 2014 9:47am,3,False,"Unless I've missed it (for which, I humbly apologise), I'm very surprised no one seems to have referenced Stanley Milgram's, 1960's experiment which confirmed, &quot;only following orders&quot; was not a German specific condition. It was, first, conducted at Yale University and has, since, been replicated, in various locations - all over the world - with similar results, each time. Given the social conditions, in post-World War one Germany, it may be an explanation why it culminated in such catastrophic consequences, during the Second World War. I won't even detail the Stanford University, Guards/Prisoners Experiment. That had to be prematurely terminated, as the &quot;Guards&quot; were becoming too &quot;enthusiastic&quot;."
241,aandrew1958,13 May 2014 10:06am,1,False,"I liked it, as it was thought provoking but I don't think it asked me to imagine what it was like to be a Nazi. They were still seen as something separate from the ordinary folk caught up in the madness."
242,martin77,13 May 2014 11:18am,2,False,"&quot; I also thought it was one of the most interesting and moving things I have seen on television in a while: superbly acted, gripping and challenging. &quot; I couldn't agree more. It looked so authentic you couldn't help think that a lot of money was spent on the production. The acting was so good that you forgot that this was actors saying their lines."
243,sanspeur,13 May 2014 12:20pm,0,False,"I thought it was too lightweight.Relating everything to the experiences of a few young people has something to commend it, the drama was easy to follow.But the subject matter is still very raw.As I said on another blog, I think that the systematic, wide ranging , brutal effects of the Nazi system were underplayed.A trainload of Jews in the middle of a landscape, in a random scene, can't be a substitute for the many death camps and forced labour sites, where millions died, transported from all over Europe.There were scenes of brutality in the combat zones.I watched the discussion programme which was aired after the last episode of this drama.I agreed that some of it was far fetched.The existence of a public relationship between a woman and her Jewish lover in 1941 I thought unrealistic."
244,cycokan,13 May 2014 1:21pm,7,False,"The point of this drama, not documentary, series is clearly addressed in it's original title: &quot;Our mothers, our fathers&quot;.  The intention was not a documentary like, 100% accurate picture of the war or the holocaust or any other aspect of WW2 in Germany, the intention was to trigger a discussion with our fathers, mothers, in reality more our grandparents, at the last chance before the last remaining eye witnesses and participants die.The question was also not only, what did the majority, different minorities, or even the artificial constructed average German do during the war, it questioned also, how the survivors mentality was damaged through the gruesome things they did by themselves, where done to them, or had witnessed during the dictatorship and the war. The survivors were our parents and grandparents, who had to live on after the war and mostly tried to be our good and beloved parents, tried to rebuild Germany, tried to re-socialise, tried to come clear with their guilt, often lied about their personal involvement, mostly simply kept quiet and avoided to speak about their personal experiences. All aspects of the war, all German mistakes and cruelties have been subject to hundreds and thousands of books, TV documentations and TV dramas, which still are in the media on daily basis. Our children get educated about them and the Nazi era remains the most wide spread issue of the curricula. There is nothing unknown in Germany and nothing is hidden or forgotten. On this background, it was much more intensive to pick a group of bohemian, liberal and educated, metropolitan youths, than a group of Nazi ideologists. In this discussion the question was asked, whether it was plausible, to have a Jewish friend in such a group in spring 1941. Surely not the standard, but possible. At least not more impossible, as a mixed group of friends mixed from bohemian, educated liberals and enthusiastic Nazis would have been.  One has to remember, that never, even at the highest point of &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot;, when party membership was more or less mandatory for career clerks and officials in any part of government and society, not more than 8 million Germans joined the NSDAP.There remained millions of people who were communists, socialists, liberals, christdemocratic conservatives at heart, who couldn't speak out openly any more and even more millions of political uninterested people. On the other hand, summer 1941 was the absolute peak of the Nazi regime, the people had jobs, Poland and France were invaded in few weeks, the systematic extinction of the Jews had not yet begun and already practised war crimes were not commonly public. Even emphatic objectors of the Nazis started to think, that maybe not all they did was that wrong, in the light of their first successes. The point of the series was not to show, that maybe your father, your mother, was a Nazi party leader or a camp commander in Auschwitz. Most of them are known and were prosecuted, so their children normally know about their parents activities during the war.  The point was, that even ordinary people, yet even cultivated and educated middle class bohemians, our beloved mothers and fathers, actively took part in, but also received, unimaginable gruesome and inhuman crimes during the war.  How was this possible and why did they not want to speak about it? To protect themselves, to just forget, shame, because they thought it's to gruesome to involve their children? Not all actions of the series were representative or common, but all of them did happen somewhere, sometimes.To pick just those aspects the authors did, was fully legitimate to construct a story for a series that intended to trigger German self reflection. Others may, or may be not allowed to generalize all WW2 Germans as monsters, we instead have to come clear with the monster in ourselves."
245,ReinerNiemand,13 May 2014 1:26pm,2,False,"Many miss the powerful feeling of US against THEM the Nazi Propaganda created quite successfully, US being the germans of the time and THEM all others, first the Jews, then the polish, russian, french, british, american, aso.The same common purpose bound together the german people into the Nazi Volksgemeinschaft (Peoples unity) against the known enemies, and swore them to a common goal (Deutschlands Wiederauferstehung/Resurrection of Germany). Not to forget the first years of the war being supremely successful on the military front. The germans really thought, they could win the war. And for the jews; anyone with a brain could see they were unjustly mistreated, but the Propaganda managed to draw a veil about the extend, and the final means. Nevertheless anyone with a brain, and an ear to the rumor mill did know what happened to them. But most did not want to know, and later denied any involvement, Speer beeing a primary example.The Wannsee conference (Endlösung der Judenfrage/Final solution of the jewish question) was held without Hitlers explicit consent and knowledge, to isolate his political persona from any possible fallout, because no leader should be involved in such inhuman policies.The DDR Propaganda later did the same against the western democracies, also very successfully and pervasive. Pervasive to the point of older eastern germans intensive feelings of having lost the common purpose (Schaffung des sozialistischen Menschen/Creation of the socialist human)."
246,Rob1949,13 May 2014 4:08pm,2,False,"I found this programme quite gripping and very well acted. German in origin, I would be surprised if it didn't portray the German people with some sympathy. Let's face it, in all USA war productions they won the war. As far as this production is concerned, I thought it was very well put together and each viewing made me impatient for the next in the series. I can remember finding a book in my parents wardrobe (kids!) called 'Lest we forget&quot; which at the age of ten, traumatised me. I could not believe that people could be so cruel and basically, evil. As much as I have tried to forget and forgive, it never really leaves me which I know is wrong but I can't help it."
247,Rob1949,13 May 2014 4:15pm,1,False,"As much as I feel as I stated on my previous posting I can't and we can't hold current generations responsible for the evils of their fathers of grandfathers (grandmothers too?) I am also aware that under the right conditions we are all capable of inflicting immense cruelty on our fellow man and that is a sad check with reality. '...cast the first stone' and all that. But crumbs, what a moving experience, at the end I almost cried. Can we have some more please, wonderful to get a German perspective. Thank you."
248,brithistory84,15 May 2014 2:12am,1,False,"Judging this film as a drama, which is the ONLY way it should be interpreted, I would say it is powerful.However the danger comes when one views it as an expression of historical discussion. Apart from highly unlikely circumstances/ occurrences in this film it leaves me with a taste that it tends towards sympathy for the leading German characters and population whilst emphasizing atrocities committed by other nationals portrayed in the film i.e Polish resistance fighters, Russian soldiers. I can understand why this film would offend some people and my concern is people not solely taking this production as a fictional work So much progress has been made by many nations in coming to terms with conduct in the Second World War and to look back with such &quot;creative licence&quot; is perhaps a large step back or worse, dangerous."
249,SolarTime2012,15 May 2014 11:44am,0,False,Considering what utter tosh the BBC WWI effort THE ARK is in its good war run by nice posh people fairy tale...the post-mortem remark can get put where the sun don't shine. Yes GEN WAR is flawed but it is also very human and very well done.One should note the characters do come from Berlin. Berlin did not votefor Hitler and had no ghetto.
250,WulfrunianInGermany,15 May 2014 4:37pm,1,False,"I haven't the time to read through all the previous comments, many of which will no doubt already have said what I will write here. So here's my take. The main criticisms (both inside and outside Germany) were 1) the continued friendship in mid-1941 of young Germans with their Jewish childhood friend. I don't think this was the norm, but not improbable either: Goebbels for example complained in his diary that after years of state-run hate propanda, most Germans now had a healthy dislike of the evil, often foreign, often leftwing caricature Jews depicted by that propaganda, but many also made exceptions for their own Jews; the secular, patriotic and non-hooked-nosed German Jews they'd known all their livesm who'd fought in the Great War and who obviously didn't resemble the caricature Jews in any way. This feat of cognitive dissonance annoyed Goebbels a lot, but it's well attested. Most Jews were still living in their old homes at this time, and many of them clearly never believed it would get so bad as it did. Deportations didn't come until much later, and even then very few people knew what was happening. We can't use our hindsight to makelazy judgements here. 2) Anti-Semitism of Poles. This caused a furore in Poland, but unfortunately it was true of a significant proportion of this deeply Catholic people. The German makers of the film perhaps missed an opportunity to present within the resistance group the full spectrum of Polish attitudes towards the Jews, which ranged from sympathy to hatred. 3) The plot device of the characters repeatedly meeting by chance on the vast Russian front is just that: coincidences worthy of a Dickens novel. But this is drama, not a documentary, and otherwise the drama of five characters simply wouldn't work. 4) Some critics say the Germans (including the four main protagonists) are shown too sympathetically. In fact they are all guilty of crimes of commission and omission, of betrayal. The other German characters shown, whether in Berlin or at the front, both male and female, are also shown in a fairly negative light. How can that be sympathetic treatment?  All in all, this was a very nuanced and thought-provoking series, long overdue."
251,BlutoBlutarsky,15 May 2014 11:45pm,0,False,"Busy lifestyle, eh? Watch out for that blood pressure, brother. If you had taken the time to read some of the other comments, you might have noticed that one flaw with this series which was pointed out was that five unlikely (and likeable) friends had been presented as the norm in 1940s Germany ('Our mothers,our fathers'), at the same time as thoroughly unpleasant and viciously anti-Semitic thugs were presented as the Polish norm. Where's the Teutonic sense of Gerechtigkeit? As for Poland being a 'deeply Catholic country' - it wasn't always like that, you know. It only became much more Catholic after 1945 for obvious reasons..."
252,Gammelpreusse,16 May 2014 10:35am,0,False,"Hate to bring it to you, but these kinda people were as part of the norm as rapists, political activists, communists, nazis, chimney sweepers, sadists, humanists, artists etc. etc., each with their own stories, attitudes and &quot;truths&quot;. Nazi stereotypes we had for 70 years straight."
253,BlutoBlutarsky,16 May 2014 10:54am,0,False,"I think you missed my point. I don't disagree with you about Nazi stereotypes, but it's ZDF which is doing the stereotyping now. They took the best Germans and presented them as typical, and took the worst Poles and presented those as typical. Not exactly fair, is it?"
254,Gammelpreusse,16 May 2014 11:37am,1,False,"And before all everybody took was the worst Nazis and presenting them as stereotypes. Was that fair? Besides, I hardly consider these folks as the &quot;best&quot; Germans, given what they did in this miniseries. That is what confuses me so much. They shoot children, drive civilians through minefields, execute village people as partisan revenge, report &quot;jews&quot;, all the stuff you read and hear about. I seriously do not get the point here.  About the Poles, that indeed could have handled better, presenting a more diverse truth."
255,BlutoBlutarsky,16 May 2014 1:11pm,0,False,"I agree with you that the friends do some terrible things (four of them, to be precise). That seems to me to be the point of the series - how war dehumanizes people, and I have no problem whatsoever with that and the film makes that credible. My point is that the friends were originally (in 1941 - after years of Nazi propaganda) still very nice people, pretty much like your average 21st century young German. That's the unbelievable bit. Especially if you consider what Wilhelm must have been doing in Poland in 1939, and yet he is still more or less an innocent in 1941 and great friends with Viktor."
256,Gammelpreusse,17 May 2014 2:17am,0,False,"You comment implies that &quot;every&quot; german in Poland was comitting war crimes and/or saw terrible things happen and became a bitter or serious person over it. And though terrible things &quot;did&quot; happen, that is not what happend, or was witnessed by every german there. Unluckily the show does say nothing if that guy was in Poland (or stationed on the French border, for example) and what he did there, so that is up for pure speculation.  Also, the most disgusting crimes were done by command units that came behind the fighting units. And even though the regular Wehrmacht was involved in warcrimes in Poland from day one, it did not involve every single unit. After Poland the bulk of the Army was pulled to the western front in preperation of the invasion of France. What a lot of people miss is that the bloodiest chapters of the war and the Holocaust began only with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, the Holocaust after the Wannsee Conference in 1942. Before that, killings alrerady happend, but not to the degree and as widespread as in later years, so it's not as far fetched as you make it out to be that the people in 41 there were emotionally still rather intact.  Finally, contrary to popular belief, Germans back then were not a monolithic society all brainwashed in Nazi ideology. Nazi support was wiedespread, but for some very different reasons amongst different people. Pretty much everybody had that one decent jew who was alright, looked alright and behaved alright, unlike the propaganda caricatures presented all the time. Is it unlikely they had such a jewish friend? yes? Impossible or implausible even? nope.  These people were not stereotypical...but then, hardly anybody was. Some were worse, some were better. Look around in your own society today, you will see people with very different backgrounds and very different opinions, supporting parties, ideas, arguments for their very own reasons and interests. Some are more radical, some less, some do not hold an opinion at all towards certain topics. It was no different back then.  The show ran outside the usual stereotypes and you have to see in the context of all the shows and movies done during the last 70 years that did not allow derivation from a very singular and one dimensional description of the Hitler fanatic as the typical german. This Propaganda, that never stopped after the war, itself has become such a common knowledge that it is interesting how much a more varied showing produces such disbelief.  Btw, I am German. I had grandfathers. One was a hard core Nazi &quot;Bonze&quot; in Bavaria, the other was a Luftwaffe Officer from Northrhine Westphalia who served in France, Africa and Italy, commanding a FlaK battery. If you compare their stories and attitudes side by side, it was if both were living on different planets."
257,BlutoBlutarsky,17 May 2014 11:58am,0,False,"Thanks for your comments, GP. I don't mean to dismiss either your views or those of Wulfrunian (above) but as you can see, what particularly gets to me is the total caricature of the Polish resistance. As you might have guessed, I'm from a Polish background and I get fed up with Poles being stereotyped as moronic anti-Semites. That ZDF should have perpetuated this is particularly irksome, because what you say about their portrayal of ordinary Germans is mostly fair. No-one is saying that decent Germans didn't exist, but why make the Poles the nasty guys? It wasn't them who crossed the German border in September 1939."
258,BlutoBlutarsky,17 May 2014 12:21pm,0,False,"And when you talk about the 'bloodiest chapters' not taking place until 1941, then I'd beg to differ. What about the bombing of Polish cities or the indiscriminate strafing of columns of civilians? It wasn't just the Gestapo and fanatical Nazis who were flying those planes."
259,Gammelpreusse,17 May 2014 12:40pm,0,False,"Fair enough, understand your reasoning here. And yeah, to be honest, I too did not quite understand this twist, either. But as someone who is quite read up in regards to polish history, what the Germans did there, the Warsaw Ghetto and the uprising late in the war, that part of the series was not my focal point.  I &quot;think&quot; it was due to the fact she show wanted to present the view that collaboration and antisemtitism was very, very widespread in Europa at that time. There is a lot of legend building in many european countries about everybody being in a resistance movement and being moral angles, which is far, far from the truth. But neither were there all rabid jew haters, so in this regard, I understand the irritation that must have caused amongst many."
260,Gammelpreusse,17 May 2014 12:46pm,0,False,"I beg to differ.  When I say &quot;bloodiest&quot; chapters, I was referring to what happend behind the frontlines, Commando units, concentration camps, mass shootings etc. Those far exceeded everything that was happening on the frontlines even taking bombings of cities and strafing civilians into account.  The examples you brought were done by every side in this war involved and is still done to this day by even the most self declared &quot;civilized&quot; nations around. That is why I am a pacifist. War removes that certain layer of accountability for personal actions, and some people will just let go. That is not a national trait, that is a human trait."
261,BlutoBlutarsky,17 May 2014 2:37pm,0,False,"GP, you are a civilised human being and thanks for taking the trouble to answer, point by point. As you may have seen from my comments further down, I lived in Germany for some years and have nothing but good memories. (And it's always good to remind everyone that the Germans produced Goethe, Schiller, ETA Hoffman, Kleist, Brecht and others who I can't think of off the top of my head). Alles Gute, Freund..."
262,BlutoBlutarsky,17 May 2014 2:41pm,0,False,"But if you know your Polish history as you say you do, then you will probably agree that, compared to some other European countries, collaboration was pretty minimal."
263,Gammelpreusse,17 May 2014 7:06pm,0,False,"No harm done, Bluto, we all are influenced by this period of time in one way or another, only thing to solve it is to actually talk about it. Thumbs up! In regards to the polish collaboration...I honestly don't know about that one. I mean, no state can stay occupied for any lengh of time without serious collaboration by at least parts of any given population, without it there simply is no way to maintain an occupation. But I never read anything in particular towards the polish situation here, I have to admit."
264,BlutoBlutarsky,17 May 2014 8:31pm,0,False,"The phrase &quot;Jaw, jaw is better than war, war&quot; was used by Churchill himself, of course, ironically enough, since he was the UK war leader. For a Polish perspective I'd recommend Halik Kochanski's book about WWII.  Cheers. Must go and eat my bigos."
