2,Marybeau,11 September 2022 8:34pm,28,False,"Not for Shane Lowry, who's on a serious roll!"
3,Wateroffaducksback,11 September 2022 10:54pm,21,False,"If Trump and the Middle East Kingdoms are the future, we are all in trouble."
4,94Murfatlar,12 September 2022 12:18am,4,False,"We're saddled with them for the present, which is a fate near enough to death."
5,brady,11 September 2022 7:54pm,67,True,Cracking finish. Thought that would drop for McIlroy and was looking forward to the extra holes. Happy to see Lowry win it though. One of the good guys.
6,extraart,11 September 2022 8:01pm,29,False,Absolutely
7,nickmannion,11 September 2022 7:57pm,103,False,"The LIV crew, a fair few who have done nothing for the old Euro tour were taking up spots here to gain points etc for majors and taking up places in the field so Euro tour journeymen, the backbone of the tour, missed out.So the LIV guys, who took the dodgy cash to 'make their families secure' and who don't need the prize money here, prevented the above Euro regulars from maybe feeding/keeping warm their families.I see...."
8,brumell,11 September 2022 8:12pm,35,False,There is no limit to how much money some people want.
9,diawa1,11 September 2022 8:20pm,52,False,"Seemingly, Poulter’s not happy with just the nine Ferraris."
10,bobby52,11 September 2022 8:24pm,51,False,"'Seemingly, Poulter’s not happy with just the nine Ferraris.' I don't think you've given enough consideration to his hardship. Are you aware of the increase in the price of petrol?"
11,diawa1,11 September 2022 8:38pm,10,False,"Bobby, I have but he can drive only the one Ferrari at a time and I don’t think he’s the sort to allow you and me to take one out for a spin for him."
12,Pilatus,11 September 2022 8:40pm,7,False,It’s a tough call for golfers. Should they take Emirati or Saudi Arabian money?
13,WillCarlingsBumChin,11 September 2022 10:22pm,6,False,Exactly. The holier-than-thou attitude of certain players is quite something.
14,KillianFromCork,11 September 2022 10:25pm,27,False,"The main criticism is them taking part in DP events, blocking genuine DP players."
15,catchytitled,11 September 2022 11:25pm,1,False,NINE (thanks Vide-printer my old buddy) Ferraris??!! Cocky much? But then I guess the Sainz have always been there.  And who am I to comment? “…..it is I…..LeClerc…”
16,Wateroffaducksback,12 September 2022 12:25am,7,False,"This is a politically bi-polar world, golfers choose like we all do. This is not about security we all know that is disingenuous nonsense - this is the sport of golf where all the top players are multiple millionaires, it is about politics. Golf is being used as a vehicle to promote an ideology. All the easy fruit has now been picked by LIV, the future of the game remains uncertain but guaranteed ugly."
17,jbuc147,12 September 2022 1:24am,4,False,Truss will cover the cost of any excess petrol/energy charges with her tax cuts for the rich policy so no worries.
18,Matteo11,12 September 2022 1:46am,6,False,"True but they have to play well for the Emerati money, they don't just get to take it."
19,Matteo11,12 September 2022 1:47am,0,False,A reply to Pilatus
20,Cowboy7,12 September 2022 4:32am,4,False,Great win for Lowry who has as many majors as the whole of wales
21,adman50,11 September 2022 8:23pm,18,False,"It's a professional sport. It's all about money. We don't even get to see live golf on FTA in the UK., Why due to the money the players want. So as the game is totally dominated by financial interest please don't expect me to cry too many tears for the present pro tours. I agree it would be better if it wasn't Saudi money, but don't pretend there isn't a lot of Dodgy money in pro sport. By the way well done to Shane Lowry. Great win"
22,ReminiscentNI,11 September 2022 9:19pm,12,False,Was there an email that came out asking for your tears?? That's pretty low.
23,BrasilBranche,11 September 2022 9:50pm,3,False,"No, it's fair. I can see both sides, those of Rory and Shane Lowry wanting to stick with the main tours and keep the game of golf going... but then you can quite easily understand why others might want to go for the money. No matter what else, they've all got families to think about, they are doing a job, and it would be remiss of them not to consider that side.  I mean, first hand, I know of a caddy that couldn't make one LIV event and missed out on quarter of a million dollars because of it. That's a caddy! One event! There are not many of us who could turn down such money, for whatever reason.  I imagine it will calm down eventually, the LIV tour will fade to nothing or perhaps combine with at least one of the other tours... cricket had it with Packer and still does with the IPL. The arguments will turn into some kind of compromise down the line. They'll have to."
24,sweedlepipeliam,11 September 2022 10:13pm,37,False,"As pointed out in a comment at the top of the page, the LIV players have hit the jackpot and now have vast amounts of cash in their bank accounts. But, that's not enough for them. They are insistent on appearing in Tour events (more money for them...) at the expense of journeymen golfers who could probably do with the prize money from these elite events.  I'm not a particularly big golf fan, but those LIV players should do one. Stick to their Saudi league and their piles of cash. Their places on the respective tours can go to less well known pros who are fighting to just appear in a tour event."
25,BrasilBranche,11 September 2022 10:41pm,5,False,"Well they have earned it by their performances throughout the year. I'm not trying to defend them in any way, I think I'm on the far side of Rory, they're a bunch of kntz... just trying to see things from their point of view a little."
26,diawa1,11 September 2022 8:33pm,31,False,"A wonderful finish to a wonderful tournament.  This is what makes golf great; the competitive environment in which you find yourself when it’s just you against the field and the financial rewards are not guaranteed or even assured. Such a shame Poulter, McDowell and company seem to have forgotten that but then they’ve never been the sharpest clubs in the bag."
27,curt42,11 September 2022 8:39pm,28,False,"Professional sport has brought much of this sociopathic, $ is god thing on itself. And it has trickled down to the public via insane ticket and eqiupment prices and truly bad behavior. It is great to see decent people like Shane and Rory still involved and winning from time to time, but for how long with the current trajectory."
28,ibby129,11 September 2022 8:39pm,16,False,Looking forward to seeing McIlroy's recovery from the trees on the 17th. I was 30 metres away and couldn't see a thing. Easily the biggest name in Golf right now . Well done Shane Lowry.
29,D4H4NI,11 September 2022 8:50pm,3,False,It was a big kuhanus shot. But not quite enough.
30,D4H4NI,11 September 2022 8:51pm,1,False,Kahunas. :-0
31,farabundovive,12 September 2022 12:26am,2,False,Not sure what Hawaiian bra straps have to do with it.

33,peter2005,11 September 2022 9:50pm,5,False,Is there a lot of difference between money going into the Dubai Port World Tour and the LIV thing?
34,Loganist,11 September 2022 10:20pm,20,False,"Yes, one is entirely dependent on blood money and one isn't. Having said that, there is a lot of hypocrisy."
35,Pyschic,11 September 2022 10:27pm,8,False,"The only butcher in a small village builds a reputation with the villagers for paying the local farmers a fair price and putting out a quality product, making a reasonable profit. He trains up a young butcher, who then sets up next door. No issue, that’s business. May the best butcher win. Here’s the catch though. The new butcher has an inheritance which allows him to pay the farmers that bit more for their beef and his specialty, mutton dressed as lamb. Over time, the new butcher gradually gets all the best cuts and the villagers start to leave the old butcher and go next door. The old butcher is eventually forced to close his doors. The villagers are sad and nostalgic, but in time forget about the old butcher. After all, they’re still getting the same meat for the same price, and the new butcher is even in time able to offer spring lamb and not just the mutton he started out with. Now, as an animal lover, I may not like butchers. But I know which butcher I like less."
36,94Murfatlar,12 September 2022 12:17am,20,False,"There is a lot of hypocrisy, on both sides. But also, there is one side that, including long, long before the big money days, took the time to build the tour and by extension the sport (in professional circles at least.) And then there is the other side- new money, haven't ever contributed anything to anything, but hey let's make our own thing and piggyback off all the work the originals have done without so much as a thanks, due credit, or any real sense of a future. Trust us, guys! And oh, yeah- just don't answer an embassy summons..."
37,rothdamn,11 September 2022 10:43pm,1,True,"I don’t like the head line tag, there is no good or bad, just several very talented and rich golfers, playing a sport they love. The entertainment for us is watching their excellence and the struggles.  It’s good Lowry won, about time and it nice to see Mcilroy/Rahm and Read find some belated form, especially for the latter pair."
38,Marybeau,11 September 2022 11:03pm,12,False,About time? Lowry is a Major winner and has won many tournaments.
39,Citizen52,12 September 2022 12:09am,4,False,It was a valid point. He hadn't won since Portrush.

41,kane333,12 September 2022 2:54am,20,False,The ‘good’ golfers are those [checks notes] not suing their previous Tours and/or depriving former colleagues of their income.
42,Droppedshot,11 September 2022 11:22pm,13,False,"Stunning round by Jon Rahm, watching him this year I’m convinced he misses more birdie putts than anyone else, simply because he has more chances . He can be a frustrating watch, but pleased he gave a good account of himself today . Hats off to Shane, a cracking round to secure the prize."
43,Gurgle,12 September 2022 1:44am,28,False,"Really glad that a LIV golfer didn’t win it. I can understand why LIV golfers did what they did in taking the blood money, but to then start law suits against the tours that made them (and in effect against the players who remained), and then to have this whole ‘cake and eat it’ mentality, it just really bugs me. I’ve followed significant portions of a lot of the LIV golfers careers, and cheered for many to win events in the past, and many of them seemed like they were really decent people, so I just wonder what changed when they signed on with LIV."
44,generalpattern,12 September 2022 3:49am,0,False,it's not the actual PGA though? had me spooked for a bit
45,anyonelistening,12 September 2022 4:48am,2,False,The LIV golfers mentioned are not big names. I do not think there were any big name LIV players involved. And very well done to Lowry.
46,Hellespont,12 September 2022 4:54am,5,False,"The Saudis are an easy target because of their appalling human rights record- I’m not sure that Rory, or any other golfer speaking out against them or their sportswashing through LIV, is saying anything we don’t know, or can be held up as a paragon of morality and honour for criticising an obviously repugnant regime. However, if he and his mates really want to make a statement, how about speaking out against the Tories’ disdain for the poor and the sleazy cronyism which they have become a byword for; or the terrifying undermining of the rule of law in the US, the manner in which the far right has become mainstream there and taken over the Republican Party, the cynical overturning of Roe vs Wade by the Supreme Court, to name just a few alarm bells. To throw stones at a Middle Eastern regime that you don’t have any affiliation to us easy enough, especially as you’re unlikely to face any practical consequences. To speak out against the problems on your doorstep, in the countries where you earn your bread and butter, requires far more courage, and would be of far more value to the poor and disenfranchised in the so called first world countries. So come on Rory and Co - I agree with your basic view on LIV, but let’s see you show the same “courage” in speaking out at developments closer to home."
47,KenMuir,12 September 2022 5:14am,31,False,"But surely the point is that McIlroy and others have not chosen a target for their criticism purely at random? They've not suddenly become global sociopolitical commentators on everything from abortion rights to Chinese treatment of Uyghurs to Putin's invasion of Ukraine. They are speaking out on one very specific topic because it directly affects their chosen career and way of life. If they choose to restrict public pronouncements on that basis and don't wander off in to the impenetrable forest of ""and I'll tell you another thing that's not right ... "" then I am quite approving of this."
48,fytin5th,12 September 2022 5:15am,17,False,Absolutely no need for him to be a politician. Talking about his own thing is quite enough.
49,CommunityMod,12 September 2022 5:31am,0,False,This discussion will close at quarter to the hour. Many thanks for joining the conversation.
