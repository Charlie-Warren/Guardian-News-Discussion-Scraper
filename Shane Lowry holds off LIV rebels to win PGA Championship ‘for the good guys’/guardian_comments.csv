2,Marybeau,11 September 2022 8:34pm,5,False,"Not for Shane Lowry, who's on a serious roll!"
3,brady,11 September 2022 7:54pm,25,True,Cracking finish. Thought that would drop for McIlroy and was looking forward to the extra holes. Happy to see Lowry win it though. One of the good guys.
4,extraart,11 September 2022 8:01pm,12,False,Absolutely
5,nickmannion,11 September 2022 7:57pm,39,False,"The LIV crew, a fair few who have done nothing for the old Euro tour were taking up spots here to gain points etc for majors and taking up places in the field so Euro tour journeymen, the backbone of the tour, missed out.So the LIV guys, who took the dodgy cash to 'make their families secure' and who don't need the prize money here, prevented the above Euro regulars from maybe feeding/keeping warm their families.I see...."
6,brumell,11 September 2022 8:12pm,9,False,There is no limit to how much money some people want.
7,diawa1,11 September 2022 8:20pm,11,False,"Seemingly, Poulter’s not happy with just the nine Ferraris."
8,bobby52,11 September 2022 8:24pm,17,False,"'Seemingly, Poulter’s not happy with just the nine Ferraris.' I don't think you've given enough consideration to his hardship. Are you aware of the increase in the price of petrol?"
9,diawa1,11 September 2022 8:38pm,2,False,"Bobby, I have but he can drive only the one Ferrari at a time and I don’t think he’s the sort to allow you and me to take one out for a spin for him."
10,Pilatus,11 September 2022 8:40pm,0,False,It’s a tough call for golfers. Should they take Emirati or Saudi Arabian money?
11,adman50,11 September 2022 8:23pm,6,False,"It's a professional sport. It's all about money. We don't even get to see live golf on FTA in the UK., Why due to the money the players want. So as the game is totally dominated by financial interest please don't expect me to cry too many tears for the present pro tours. I agree it would be better if it wasn't Saudi money, but don't pretend there isn't a lot of Dodgy money in pro sport. By the way well done to Shane Lowry. Great win"
12,ReminiscentNI,11 September 2022 9:19pm,1,False,Was there an email that came out asking for your tears?? That's pretty low.
13,BrasilBranche,11 September 2022 9:50pm,0,False,"No, it's fair. I can see both sides, those of Rory and Shane Lowry wanting to stick with the main tours and keep the game of golf going... but then you can quite easily understand why others might want to go for the money. No matter what else, they've all got families to think about, they are doing a job, and it would be remiss of them not to consider that side.  I mean, first hand, I know of a caddy that couldn't make one LIV event and missed out on quarter of a million dollars because of it. That's a caddy! One event! There are not many of us who could turn down such money, for whatever reason.  I imagine it will calm down eventually, the LIV tour will fade to nothing or perhaps combine with at least one of the other tours... cricket had it with Packer and still does with the IPL. The arguments will turn into some kind of compromise down the line. They'll have to."
14,diawa1,11 September 2022 8:33pm,5,False,"A wonderful finish to a wonderful tournament.  This is what makes golf great; the competitive environment in which you find yourself when it’s just you against the field and the financial rewards are not guaranteed or even assured. Such a shame Poulter, McDowell and company seem to have forgotten that but then they’ve never been the sharpest clubs in the bag."
15,curt42,11 September 2022 8:39pm,6,False,"Professional sport has brought much of this sociopathic, $ is god thing on itself. And it has trickled down to the public via insane ticket and eqiupment prices and truly bad behavior. It is great to see decent people like Shane and Rory still involved and winning from time to time, but for how long with the current trajectory."
16,ibby129,11 September 2022 8:39pm,3,False,Looking forward to seeing McIlroy's recovery from the trees on the 17th. I was 30 metres away and couldn't see a thing. Easily the biggest name in Golf right now . Well done Shane Lowry.
17,D4H4NI,11 September 2022 8:50pm,0,False,It was a big kuhanus shot. But not quite enough.
18,D4H4NI,11 September 2022 8:51pm,0,False,Kahunas. :-0

20,peter2005,11 September 2022 9:50pm,0,False,Is there a lot of difference between money going into the Dubai Port World Tour and the LIV thing?
